00:00:54,500 --> 00:01:03,300
Home Alone -  2
Lost in Newyork

3
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:21,870
Where are my golf balls?

4
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,680
Anyone seen my sun block?

5
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:30,470
What's the point of going to Florida
if you use sun block?

6
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:33,410
I don't care, I'm getting toasted.

7
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:37,440
Great. Now you can be a skag
with a darker shade of skin.

8
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:42,010
He's jealous because he can't tan.
His freckles just connect.

9
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:46,210
Hey, hey, easy on the fluids!
The rubber sheets are packed.

10
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:47,780
{\i1}She wants "Ding. "{\i0}

11
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:50,480
{\i1}Behind "Ding" is 200 points!{\i0}

12
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:51,820
{\i1}All right!{\i0}

13
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,690
{\i1}That gives you 4700 points.{\i0}

14
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:57,020
{\i1}200 points! All right!{\i0}

15
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:02,020
Honey, are you packed yet?

16
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:03,590
Yes.

17
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:05,190
{\i1}Yes.{\i0}

18
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,460
Everything I put out?

19
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:10,930
Yes.

20
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:12,890
{\i1}Yes.{\i0}

21
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:15,590
Oh, did you see what Grandma sent you?

22
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:18,700
Let me guess. Donald Duck slippers?

23
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:20,660
Close.

24
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:23,860
Inflatable clown to play with
in the pool.

25
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:25,130
How exciting.

26
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:29,900
Why Florida? There's no
Christmas trees in Florida.

27
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:31,970
What is it with Christmas trees?

28
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:35,200
How can you have Christmas
without a Christmas tree?

29
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:39,100
We'll find a nice fake silver one.
Or decorate a palm tree.

30
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:47,740
{\i1}Guests of Ding, Dang, Dong
stay at the world-renowned Plaza Hotel:{\i0}

31
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:50,440
{\i1}New York's most exciting
hotel experience.{\i0}

32
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:54,310
{\i1}For reservations, call toll-free,
1- 800-759...{\i0}

33
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:59,780
- Where's the camcorder battery?
- I put it in the charger.

34
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:13,090
How's this?

35
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,750
Oh, much better.

36
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:18,950
Kevin, put your tie on. We'll be
late for the Christmas pageant.

37
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:23,390
It's in the bathroom. I can't go in.
Uncle Frank's taking a shower.

38
00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:28,390
He says if I walk in there and see him
naked, I'd never feel like a real man.

39
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:31,060
Whatever that means.

40
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:37,460
I'm sure he was kidding.
Just run in and get your tie...

41
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:39,930
...get out, and don't look
at anything.

42
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,470
{\i1}Well{\i0}

43
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:48,370
{\i1}This cat they're talking about
I wonder who, could it be{\i0}

44
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:51,430
{\i1}'Cause I know I'm the heaviest cat{\i0}

45
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:54,840
{\i1}The heaviest cat you ever did see{\i0}

46
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:57,740
{\i1}When they see me
Walkin ' down the street{\i0}

47
00:04:57,910 --> 00:05:00,740
{\i1}None of the fellas want to speak
Hey, hey, hey{\i0}

48
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:04,070
{\i1}On their faces they wear a silly smirk
'Cause they know{\i0}

49
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:08,010
{\i1}I'm the king
Of the cool jerks{\i0}

50
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:14,210
Get out of here, you pervert,
or I'll slap you silly!

51
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,840
Oh, you're cooking, Frankie.

52
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:30,880
{\i1}Christmas tree
My Christmas tree{\i0}

53
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,720
{\i1}Lit up like a star{\i0}

54
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:38,050
{\i1}When I see
My Christmas tree{\i0}

55
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:41,990
{\i1}Can loved ones be far{\i0}

56
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:45,120
{\i1}Christmas tree
I'm certain{\i0}

57
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:48,660
{\i1}Wherever I roam{\i0}

58
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:51,930
Kevin's solo's coming up.
Tell Leslie.

59
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,460
Kevin's solo's coming up.
Tell Frank.

60
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:56,730
Okay. Frank.

61
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:58,460
Frank!

62
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:06,370
{\i1}Christmastime means laughter{\i0}

63
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:09,870
{\i1}Toboggans in the snow{\i0}

64
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:13,230
{\i1}Caroling together{\i0}

65
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:16,970
{\i1}With faces aglow{\i0}

66
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,540
{\i1}Stockings on the mantel{\i0}

67
00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:23,970
{\i1}A wreath on the door{\i0}

68
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:27,810
{\i1}And my merriest Christmas{\i0}

69
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:31,540
{\i1}Needs just one thing more{\i0}

70
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:33,040
{\i1}Christmas tree{\i0}

71
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:35,680
{\i1}My Christmas tree{\i0}

72
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:53,180
Kevin!

73
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:03,120
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury...

74
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:11,890
...I'd like to apologize
for whatever displeasure...

75
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:14,190
...I might have caused you.
- What?

76
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:17,730
My prank was immature and ill-timed.

77
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:21,330
Immature or not, it was
pretty darn hilarious.

78
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,600
I also apologize to my brother.

79
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:28,600
Kevin.

80
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:29,770
I'm sorry.

81
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,040
Oh, Buzz...

82
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,730
...that was very nice.

83
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:42,510
Kevin, do you have something to say?

84
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,210
Beat that, you trout-sniffer.

85
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,620
I'm not sorry. I did it
because Buzz humiliated me.

86
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:13,420
He gets away with everything,
so I got him.

87
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:15,790
Since you stupidly
believe his lies...

88
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:18,950
...I don't care if your
Florida trip is wrecked.

89
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:22,190
Who wants to spend Christmas
in a tropical climate?

90
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:24,160
Kevin!

91
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:26,660
You walk out,
you sleep on the 3rd floor.

92
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:28,630
Yeah, with me.

93
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,020
So, what else is new?

94
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:34,890
Don't wreck my trip.
Your dad's paying good money for it.

95
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:38,360
Wouldn't want to spoil your fun,
Mr. Cheapskate.

96
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:45,760
What a troubled young man.

97
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:52,630
They're all a bunch of jerks.

98
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:55,100
Hi.

99
00:08:57,140 --> 00:09:01,670
Last time we tried to take a trip,
we had a problem just like this.

100
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:03,870
Yeah, with me getting crapped on.

101
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:08,340
I don't care for your choice of words.
That's not what happened.

102
00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:10,740
Buzz apologized to you.

103
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:13,210
Yeah, then he called me
a trout-sniffer.

104
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:16,340
He didn't mean it.
He was just sucking up to you.

105
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:20,710
Okay, why don't you just sit up here
and think things over?

106
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:24,550
When you're ready to apologize
to everyone, you can come down.

107
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:28,280
I'm not apologizing to Buzz.
I'd rather kiss a toilet seat!

108
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:31,050
Then stay up here all night.

109
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:35,280
I don't want to go down anyway!
I can't trust anybody in this family.

110
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:39,290
You know what? If I had my own
money, I'd go on my own vacation.

111
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:44,120
Alone, without any of you. And I'd
have the most fun of my whole life.

112
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:47,690
You got your wish last year.
Maybe you will this year.

113
00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:49,260
I hope so.

114
00:10:38,210 --> 00:10:40,110
- We did it again!
- We did it again!

115
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:53,480
Our McCallisters here,
other McCallisters there.

116
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:57,690
I shouldn't complain, but
you give the worst wake-up calls.

117
00:10:57,950 --> 00:11:01,490
- Do you have the tickets?
- I've got them. Here's your family's.

118
00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:03,520
- How many do you have?
- Seven.

119
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,760
- We have seven.
- 14!

120
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:10,830
Seven...

121
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:11,860
...eight...

122
00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:15,530
...nine, ten.
- How come we're not sitting together?

123
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:19,790
This time of year, we're lucky to get
on the same plane. 11, 12, 13.

124
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:23,930
Where's Kevin?

125
00:11:25,270 --> 00:11:26,630
14.

126
00:11:26,830 --> 00:11:30,970
Good thing I have my own ticket,
just in case you try to ditch me.

127
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,340
- Come on.
- I need batteries.

128
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:45,840
I'll give them to you on the plane.

129
00:11:46,010 --> 00:11:48,270
- Here's two more.
- Why not now?

130
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:51,610
Not now! What's the gate number?

131
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:52,840
H-17.

132
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:57,640
Better hurry, it's the last gate.
Dad, what gate is it?

133
00:11:57,910 --> 00:11:59,810
H-17, Buzz. Come on, Kevin.

134
00:12:00,450 --> 00:12:02,810
Kevin, you gonna take my bag?
Take my bag.

135
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,910
Come on. Come on.

136
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:34,360
{\i1}American Airlines
flight 226 to New York...{\i0}

137
00:12:34,590 --> 00:12:37,260
{\i1}...is now in the final
boarding process.{\i0}

138
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:42,630
Come on. Come on!

139
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:46,000
Dad, wait up!

140
00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:52,500
Dad, wait up!

141
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:55,000
Wait up!

142
00:12:56,370 --> 00:12:57,370
Wait!

143
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,610
Come on, come on!

144
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:07,570
Dad, wait!

145
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:14,610
Here we are! Here!

146
00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:19,480
We made it.

147
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:22,010
Everybody here? We made it?
All right.

148
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:24,450
Please board, the plane's leaving.

149
00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:27,950
- I'll make sure everyone gets on.
- We'll get everyone on.

150
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:30,950
Merry Christmas. Have a nice flight.

151
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,720
Bye.
- Bye-bye.

152
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:36,890
Hey, wait up!

153
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,920
Hey, guys, wait for me!

154
00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:42,690
- Cutting it kind of close.
- Yes.

155
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:44,760
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.

156
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:45,790
Wait!

157
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:48,760
Wait!

158
00:13:50,090 --> 00:13:53,260
- I'm sorry.
- That's okay. Are you on this flight?

159
00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:57,090
Yeah. My family's on the plane.
I don't want to be left here.

160
00:13:57,330 --> 00:13:59,830
- Do you have a boarding pass?
- Somewhere...

161
00:14:00,030 --> 00:14:01,490
They're ready to go.

162
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:02,760
He dropped his pass.

163
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,530
This happened to me last year
and almost wrecked my Christmas.

164
00:14:06,770 --> 00:14:08,470
You sure your family's onboard?

165
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:11,840
My dad ran in right before
I bumped into this lady.

166
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:16,500
Board him. Make sure he locates
his family before you leave him.

167
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:18,170
Okay. Come on.

168
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:23,040
Do you see your family?

169
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:24,970
There's my dad.

170
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:28,770
- Find an empty seat. Merry Christmas.
- You too.

171
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:31,210
{\i1}In order to push back from the gate...{\i0}

172
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,610
{\i1}...all passengers must have
their seat belts fastened.{\i0}

173
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,890
So have you ever been to Florida?

174
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:34,600
{\i1}Welcome aboard American Airlines
flight 176 non-stop to New York.{\i0}

175
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:47,440
{\i1}I didn't think we'd make it.{\i0}

176
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:52,170
Something wrong?

177
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,610
Honey?

178
00:15:54,110 --> 00:15:55,680
I have that feeling.

179
00:15:56,810 --> 00:15:58,610
We forgot something?

180
00:15:59,510 --> 00:16:03,350
No, I don't think we did,
but I just have that feeling.

181
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:04,910
Just bad memories.

182
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:09,810
We did everything, brought everything.
We have everybody.

183
00:16:10,050 --> 00:16:11,720
There's nothing to worry about.

184
00:16:14,090 --> 00:16:18,420
{\i1}Yeah. Yeah, you're right.
You're right. We're fine.{\i0}

185
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,920
{\i1}Nothing to worry about.{\i0}

186
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,730
Mom?

187
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:44,660
Dad?

188
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:47,360
Uncle Frank?

189
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:50,070
Buzz?

190
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:00,540
We're the last ones off the plane.

191
00:17:05,170 --> 00:17:07,470
Where are those guys?

192
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:15,040
Is this Megan's?
It's Brooke's.

193
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:18,650
Give this to Brooke, this to Kevin.

194
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:21,850
- Give this... Give this to Kevin.
- Give this to Kevin.

195
00:17:22,050 --> 00:17:23,250
Give this to Kevin.

196
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:24,520
- Kevin.
- Kevin.

197
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:26,850
- Give this to Kevin.
- Give this to Kevin.

198
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:29,080
- Give this to Kevin.
- Kevin.

199
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,950
- Give this to Kevin.
- Here you go, Kevin.

200
00:17:39,090 --> 00:17:41,550
- Kevin's not here.
- Kevin's not here.

201
00:17:41,890 --> 00:17:44,290
- Kevin's not here.
- Kevin's not here.

202
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:47,020
- Kevin's not here.
- Kevin's not here.

203
00:17:47,290 --> 00:17:49,760
- Kevin's not here.
- Kevin's not here.

204
00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:51,420
Kevin's not here.

205
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:53,230
Kevin's not here.

206
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:55,730
What!

207
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:01,000
Kevin!

208
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:31,310
Excuse me, this is an emergency!

209
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:34,080
Yes, sir?

210
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:35,580
What city is that?

211
00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:39,140
That's New York.

212
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:42,110
Yikes, I did it again!

213
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:48,450
Something wrong, sir?

214
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:53,450
I'll be fine.

215
00:19:02,690 --> 00:19:07,220
Oh, no. My family's in Florida
and I'm in New York.

216
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:11,720
My family's in Florida?

217
00:19:11,990 --> 00:19:13,320
I'm in...

218
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:15,760
...New York?

219
00:20:25,450 --> 00:20:27,060
Wow.

220
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:02,970
What's the child's name?

221
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,900
- Kevin.
- K-E-V-I-N.

222
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:08,140
When did you see him last?

223
00:21:08,370 --> 00:21:09,340
Curbside check-in?

224
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:12,910
No, I saw him at the door.
He was with us in the terminal.

225
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:18,710
Most people get separated at security.
Did everyone get through security?

226
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,880
I don't know. Peter...

227
00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:23,910
We were in a hurry.
We ran all the way to the gate.

228
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:27,210
When did you notice he was missing?

229
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:30,780
When we picked up our baggage here.

230
00:21:31,650 --> 00:21:34,620
- Has the boy ever run away from home?
- No.

231
00:21:34,850 --> 00:21:37,620
Has he ever been in a situation
on his own?

232
00:21:42,790 --> 00:21:45,490
As a matter of fact,
this has happened before.

233
00:21:46,090 --> 00:21:49,260
It's becoming a McCallister
family travel tradition.

234
00:21:50,390 --> 00:21:53,760
Funnily enough,
we never lose our luggage.

235
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:08,960
He was left at home,
by accident, last year.

236
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,830
That's what my wife meant calling it
a McCallister family travel tradition.

237
00:22:16,530 --> 00:22:18,230
We'll call Chicago and...

238
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:20,740
...notify them of the situation.

239
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,340
The odds are that's where he is.

240
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:24,910
Thanks.

241
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:28,540
Very unlikely he'd be anywhere else.

242
00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:45,180
Watch out, kid!

243
00:22:57,820 --> 00:22:59,820
Yo, where's your manifest?

244
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:07,160
Here we are, Marv, New York City.

245
00:23:07,390 --> 00:23:09,590
The land of opportunity.

246
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:12,090
Smell that?

247
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:13,390
Yeah.

248
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:15,030
Know what that is?

249
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:17,890
- Fish.
- It's freedom.

250
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:19,890
No, it's fish.

251
00:23:20,130 --> 00:23:23,160
- It's freedom and it's money.
- Okay, okay.

252
00:23:23,430 --> 00:23:24,260
It's freedom.

253
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:26,930
Come on, let's go before
someone sees us.

254
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:28,800
And it's fish.

255
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:37,000
Yes, one quick score.

256
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:39,970
We get ourselves
some phony passports...

257
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:43,070
...and we hightail it
to some foreign country.

258
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:45,040
Arizona?

259
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:52,310
That's very smart, Marv.

260
00:23:52,610 --> 00:23:55,580
You bust out of jail to rob 14 cents
from a Santy Claus?

261
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,080
Every bit helps.

262
00:23:57,580 --> 00:24:00,150
Besides, now we got our new nickname.

263
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:02,950
We're the Sticky Bandits!

264
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:05,010
Real cute.

265
00:24:05,650 --> 00:24:07,110
Very cute.

266
00:24:23,590 --> 00:24:27,920
"The Plaza Hotel. New York's most
exciting hotel experience. "

267
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:42,600
Sick!

268
00:25:39,450 --> 00:25:40,920
What's the matter?

269
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:43,220
Thought I saw something.

270
00:25:58,690 --> 00:26:01,430
Serves you right! Come on, let's go.

271
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:03,500
I think she likes me.

272
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:06,160
Ahh.

273
00:26:40,550 --> 00:26:42,280
Excuse me, where's the lobby?

274
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:45,350
- Down the hall and to the left.
- Thanks.

275
00:26:59,190 --> 00:27:00,590
Wow.

276
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:11,360
{\i1}Guests of
the new Celebrity Ding-Dang-Dong...{\i0}

277
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:14,290
{\i1}...stay at the world-renowned
Plaza Hotel:{\i0}

278
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:16,930
{\i1}New York's most exciting
hotel experience.{\i0}

279
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:18,990
{\i1}For reservations, call toll-free...{\i0}

280
00:27:19,230 --> 00:27:23,230
{\i1}...1-800-759-3000.{\i0}

281
00:27:24,630 --> 00:27:26,600
I'll do just that.

282
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:30,200
Howdy-do. This is Peter
McCallister. The father.

283
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:32,070
I'd like a hotel room.

284
00:27:32,330 --> 00:27:34,770
With an extra-large bed, a TV...

285
00:27:35,030 --> 00:27:37,900
...and one of those little
refrigerators with a key.

286
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:40,600
Credit card? You got it.

287
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:46,510
Plaza Reservations, may I help you?

288
00:27:46,770 --> 00:27:49,440
{\i1}Howdy-do. This is Peter McCallister.{\i0}

289
00:27:49,610 --> 00:27:51,110
{\i1}The father.{\i0}

290
00:27:51,310 --> 00:27:53,110
{\i1}Yes, sir.
- I'd like a hotel room.{\i0}

291
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:56,610
{\i1}Yes.
- With an extra-large bed, a TV...{\i0}

292
00:27:56,840 --> 00:28:00,680
{\i1}...and one of those little
refrigerators with a key.{\i0}

293
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:03,380
You'll need a major credit card.

294
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:06,380
{\i1}Credit card? You got it.{\i0}

295
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:09,350
{\i1}Thank you. Enjoy your stay.{\i0}

296
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:15,720
Yes, two at eight, Henri.
Mr. Yamamoto.

297
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:17,790
Hold on a second.

298
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:23,920
I'll call you back.

299
00:28:27,290 --> 00:28:28,290
Hi.

300
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:33,990
Can I help you?

301
00:28:34,390 --> 00:28:36,060
Reservation for McCallister.

302
00:28:38,230 --> 00:28:40,230
A reservation for yourself?

303
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:44,900
My feet are hardly touching the ground.
I can barely see over the counter.

304
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:47,700
How can I make a reservation
for a room?

305
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:51,970
Think about it: A kid going into
a hotel making a reservation?

306
00:28:52,930 --> 00:28:54,070
I don't think so.

307
00:28:55,770 --> 00:28:57,270
I'm confused.

308
00:28:57,570 --> 00:29:01,170
I'm traveling with my dad.
He's on business. He's at a meeting.

309
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:05,640
I hate meetings. I'm not allowed
to go in, only to sit in the lobby.

310
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:06,870
That's boring.

311
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:08,870
So my dad dropped me off.

312
00:29:10,210 --> 00:29:13,440
Gave me his credit card and said
to have check-in...

313
00:29:13,670 --> 00:29:16,810
...let me in the room
so I won't get into mischief.

314
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:19,510
Ma'am, sometimes I do
get into mischief.

315
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:22,810
We all do.

316
00:29:25,450 --> 00:29:27,080
Merry Christmas.

317
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:29,780
No sign of him.

318
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:33,880
We'll need to be in touch.
You have hotel rooms?

319
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:37,450
- Yeah.
- Do you have a recent photo of him?

320
00:29:39,450 --> 00:29:41,450
I have one in my wallet.

321
00:29:42,790 --> 00:29:44,350
I don't have my wallet.

322
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:47,490
My wallet's in my bag.

323
00:29:47,790 --> 00:29:51,460
Kevin was looking in my bag at
the airport. He has my wallet.

324
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:54,730
- Did you have credit cards?
- Credit cards, money...

325
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:57,260
We'll notify the credit card
companies.

326
00:29:57,530 --> 00:30:02,190
If your son has the cards, we can get
a location on him when he uses them.

327
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:05,230
I don't think he knows
how to use a credit card.

328
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:09,300
Wow! It worked!

329
00:30:13,570 --> 00:30:15,430
- Cedric.
- Yes?

330
00:30:15,670 --> 00:30:18,770
- Don't count your tips in public.
- I'm sorry.

331
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:23,300
And find out everything you can
about that young fellow.

332
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,270
Front, please!

333
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:33,070
Enjoy your stay with us.

334
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:36,240
Don't forget to remind
your dad, when he arrives...

335
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:39,380
...he must come down and
sign a couple of things.

336
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:42,780
- Thank you, you've been helpful.
May I take your bag?

337
00:30:47,610 --> 00:30:49,150
Up here to your left.

338
00:30:49,950 --> 00:30:52,650
Herbert Hoover
once stayed on this floor.

339
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:54,250
The vacuum guy?

340
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:56,680
No, the president.

341
00:31:01,590 --> 00:31:04,390
This is one of our finest suites, sir.

342
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:14,190
This is great!

343
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:23,130
Wow! A huge bed just for me!

344
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:32,730
Luxurious and spacious.

345
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:40,170
How convenient.

346
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:45,040
Hey.

347
00:31:47,410 --> 00:31:51,040
Did you want the key in the bag?
Or did you want to hang on to it?

348
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:52,710
I'll hang on to it.

349
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:57,740
Everything all right?

350
00:31:57,940 --> 00:32:00,210
- Is the temperature okay?
- It's okay.

351
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:04,380
- Do you know how the TV works?
- I'm 10 years old. TV's my life.

352
00:32:05,550 --> 00:32:06,910
Well...

353
00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:11,780
I'm sorry.

354
00:32:17,250 --> 00:32:19,890
And there's plenty more
where that came from.

355
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:23,620
Thank you.

356
00:32:51,130 --> 00:32:53,630
Would you mind if I worked
on my cannonballs?

357
00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:55,370
No.

358
00:32:56,270 --> 00:32:57,100
Thanks.

359
00:33:10,770 --> 00:33:12,170
Yikes!

360
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:35,950
This is a vacation.

361
00:33:36,850 --> 00:33:38,450
{\i1}Hold it right there!{\i0}

362
00:33:39,190 --> 00:33:40,820
{\i1}It's me, Johnny.{\i0}

363
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:42,550
{\i1}I knew it was you.{\i0}

364
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:45,560
{\i1}I could smell you getting off
the elevator.{\i0}

365
00:33:46,990 --> 00:33:50,690
- Two scoops, sir?
- Two? Make it three, I'm not driving.

366
00:33:50,890 --> 00:33:54,920
{\i1}Gardenias, Johnny, your favorite.
- Thank you.{\i0}

367
00:33:55,290 --> 00:33:57,590
{\i1}You was here last night too,
wasn't you?{\i0}

368
00:33:58,460 --> 00:34:00,730
{\i1}I was singing at the Blue Monkey
last night.{\i0}

369
00:34:00,930 --> 00:34:03,330
She was not.
She was smooching your brother.

370
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:07,360
{\i1}You was here and you was
smooching with my brother.{\i0}

371
00:34:07,630 --> 00:34:09,200
{\i1}That's a dirty lie.
- See?{\i0}

372
00:34:09,370 --> 00:34:12,270
{\i1}Don't give me that.
You been smooching everybody!{\i0}

373
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:15,070
{\i1}Snuffy, Al, Leo...{\i0}

374
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:19,740
{\i1}...Little Moe with the gimpy leg,
Cheeks, Boney Bob, Cliff...{\i0}

375
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:21,700
{\i1}I could go on forever, baby.{\i0}

376
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,600
{\i1}You have me all wrong!{\i0}

377
00:34:23,870 --> 00:34:24,840
{\i1}All right...{\i0}

378
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:26,340
{\i1}...I believe you.{\i0}

379
00:34:26,570 --> 00:34:28,870
{\i1}But my Tommy gun don't!{\i0}

380
00:34:29,410 --> 00:34:30,610
{\i1}Johnny!{\i0}

381
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:33,110
{\i1}You're the only duck in my pond!{\i0}

382
00:34:33,310 --> 00:34:35,940
{\i1}Get down on your knees
and tell me you love me.{\i0}

383
00:34:36,210 --> 00:34:38,980
{\i1}Baby! I'm over the moon for you!{\i0}

384
00:34:39,140 --> 00:34:41,010
{\i1}You gotta do better than that!{\i0}

385
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:46,810
{\i1}If my love was an ocean, Lindy'd have
to take two planes to get across it.{\i0}

386
00:34:48,210 --> 00:34:51,280
{\i1}Maybe I'm off my hinges,
but I believe you.{\i0}

387
00:34:52,180 --> 00:34:54,050
{\i1}That's why I'm letting you go.{\i0}

388
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:58,520
{\i1}I'm gonna give you till the count
of three, to get your lousy...{\i0}

389
00:34:58,990 --> 00:34:59,920
{\i1}...lying...{\i0}

390
00:35:00,250 --> 00:35:03,990
{\i1}...lowdown, four-flushing carcass
out my door!{\i0}

391
00:35:04,490 --> 00:35:06,090
She's rat bait.

392
00:35:06,390 --> 00:35:07,290
{\i1}One!{\i0}

393
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:09,520
{\i1}Two!{\i0}

394
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:19,430
{\i1}Three!{\i0}

395
00:35:20,130 --> 00:35:22,990
{\i1}Merry Christmas, you filthy animal.{\i0}

396
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,930
{\i1}And a Happy New Year.{\i0}

397
00:36:00,010 --> 00:36:01,080
Housekeeping.

398
00:36:42,130 --> 00:36:46,530
{\i1}We know a guy who can do the cool jerk{\i0}

399
00:36:47,730 --> 00:36:52,000
{\i1}We know a guy who can do the cool jerk{\i0}

400
00:36:52,230 --> 00:36:55,700
{\i1}This cat they're talkin ' about{\i0}

401
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:58,540
{\i1}I wonder who could it be{\i0}

402
00:36:58,770 --> 00:37:01,700
{\i1}'Cause I know I'm the heaviest cat{\i0}

403
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:04,800
{\i1}The heaviest cat you ever did see{\i0}

404
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:07,810
{\i1}When they see me
Walkin ' down the street{\i0}

405
00:37:08,110 --> 00:37:10,740
{\i1}None of the fellas want to speak
Hey, hey, hey{\i0}

406
00:37:10,910 --> 00:37:13,810
{\i1}On their faces they wear a silly smirk
'Cause they know{\i0}

407
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:18,370
{\i1}I'm the king of the cool jerks{\i0}

408
00:37:22,180 --> 00:37:25,680
{\i1}Get out of here, you pervert,
or I'll slap you silly!{\i0}

409
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:27,210
Uh...

410
00:37:29,750 --> 00:37:32,150
{\i1}Oh, you're cooking, Frankie.{\i0}

411
00:37:34,350 --> 00:37:35,920
Oh, my foot!

412
00:38:08,730 --> 00:38:11,360
Didn't look this bad on our honeymoon.

413
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:29,900
Uncle Rob lives here.

414
00:38:30,470 --> 00:38:33,510
If they're back from Paris,
I'll drop in on them.

415
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:36,380
They usually give pretty
good presents.

416
00:39:35,770 --> 00:39:37,230
Good night, Mom.

417
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:44,500
Good night, Kevin.

418
00:40:11,450 --> 00:40:13,150
Your drawers, sir.

419
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:18,220
Don't flash these babies around here!
There could be girls on this floor!

420
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:20,090
I was very careful, sir.

421
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:23,090
You can't be too careful
with underwear.

422
00:40:23,290 --> 00:40:24,450
I understand.

423
00:40:25,150 --> 00:40:27,520
I'm sorry. You wanted a tip.

424
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:32,120
That won't be necessary, sir.
I still have some tip left over.

425
00:40:33,820 --> 00:40:34,990
No tip?

426
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:36,660
Okay.

427
00:40:37,690 --> 00:40:39,990
No, no, wait, wait, wait, wait!

428
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:45,830
The doorman will be happy
to find you a taxi...

429
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:47,400
Mr. McCallister.

430
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:52,130
Excuse me.

431
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:53,530
Sure.

432
00:40:56,770 --> 00:40:58,730
And how are we this morning?

433
00:40:58,970 --> 00:41:02,100
- Fine. Is my transportation here?
- Out in front, sir.

434
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:04,770
A limousine and a pizza.

435
00:41:04,970 --> 00:41:06,640
Compliments of the Plaza Hotel.

436
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:10,210
I do hope your father understands
that last night...

437
00:41:10,470 --> 00:41:14,010
...I was simply checking to see
that everything was in order.

438
00:41:14,210 --> 00:41:15,840
Oh, he was pretty mad.

439
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:17,140
He was?

440
00:41:17,340 --> 00:41:20,780
He said he didn't come here
to have his naked rear spied on.

441
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:23,050
Of course not.

442
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:25,240
Will he be down soon?

443
00:41:25,510 --> 00:41:26,580
He already left.

444
00:41:29,450 --> 00:41:32,580
I would've liked to have offered
my personal apology.

445
00:41:32,980 --> 00:41:36,150
If a guy saw you in the shower,
would you want to see him?

446
00:41:36,950 --> 00:41:38,420
I suppose not.

447
00:41:38,750 --> 00:41:40,750
I don't think you'll see him again.

448
00:41:41,690 --> 00:41:42,750
I understand.

449
00:41:44,350 --> 00:41:45,620
Bye.

450
00:41:48,190 --> 00:41:49,990
Have a lovely day.

451
00:41:59,260 --> 00:42:01,390
McCallister...

452
00:42:14,260 --> 00:42:16,900
- Good morning, Mr. McCallister.
- Morning.

453
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:27,340
Mr. McCallister,
here's your very own...

454
00:42:27,570 --> 00:42:29,170
...cheese pizza.

455
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:53,320
- Hello?
- Hello.

456
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:54,950
Know any good toy stores?

457
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:57,020
Yes, sir.

458
00:43:08,590 --> 00:43:09,860
Ahh.

459
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:16,460
Bingo!

460
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:34,870
Get outta here! Go on, get
outta here! Get outta here!

461
00:43:35,100 --> 00:43:37,330
Beat it! Beat it! Get outta here!

462
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:41,230
Hey, Marv! Get over here!
I gotta talk to you!

463
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:52,940
Whoa, whoa!

464
00:43:55,410 --> 00:43:58,910
- Would you like a scarf?
- Forget about that, we gotta talk.

465
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:04,580
We don't have the equipment to pull off
anything big: Banks, jewelry stores...

466
00:44:05,150 --> 00:44:09,010
We don't want goods.
We need cash and we need it now.

467
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:10,510
How about...

468
00:44:10,780 --> 00:44:11,980
...hotels?

469
00:44:12,250 --> 00:44:13,950
Tourists carry lots of cash.

470
00:44:14,150 --> 00:44:19,050
I got a better idea. Stores ain't
depositing cash on Christmas Eve.

471
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:24,490
The stores that will have cash are the
ones dealing in moderate priced goods.

472
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:25,890
Right. Right.

473
00:44:26,190 --> 00:44:29,890
Ergo, what store's gonna make
the most cash on Christmas Eve...

474
00:44:30,150 --> 00:44:31,920
...that nobody's gonna rob?

475
00:44:32,860 --> 00:44:33,890
Candy stores.

476
00:44:35,220 --> 00:44:37,190
Nine-year-olds rob candy stores.

477
00:44:38,260 --> 00:44:40,060
This is what I had in mind:

478
00:44:42,290 --> 00:44:45,060
That's brilliant, Harry! Brilliant!

479
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:51,130
Nobody's dumb enough to knock off
a toy store on Christmas Eve.

480
00:44:51,330 --> 00:44:53,200
Oh, yes, there is.

481
00:45:11,340 --> 00:45:14,770
Here we are, sir: Duncan's Toy Chest.

482
00:45:15,770 --> 00:45:18,040
Merry Christmas, Kevin.

483
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:03,360
This is the greatest accident
of my life.

484
00:46:21,730 --> 00:46:23,740
Marv. Marv!

485
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:27,000
Hey, nice house.
But there's no bathroom in it.

486
00:46:29,770 --> 00:46:30,940
So, what's the plan?

487
00:46:31,140 --> 00:46:35,810
Everyone leaves for a holiday off.
We come out of our houses.

488
00:46:39,310 --> 00:46:40,310
Yeah, then what?

489
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:42,910
We empty the registers and walk out.

490
00:46:43,140 --> 00:46:45,110
Great plan, Harry!

491
00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:49,110
Well, now, thank you
and Merry Christmas.

492
00:46:49,310 --> 00:46:51,380
Say hello to the family.

493
00:46:54,150 --> 00:46:55,750
Let me see.

494
00:46:57,680 --> 00:46:59,050
You shopping alone?

495
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:02,520
In New York?
Sir, I'm afraid of my own shadow.

496
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:06,120
- I was just checking.
- That's very responsible of you.

497
00:47:06,390 --> 00:47:07,850
Oh, well, thank you.

498
00:47:08,090 --> 00:47:09,490
My pleasure.

499
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:14,290
That'll be $23.75.

500
00:47:15,930 --> 00:47:18,520
My, my, my.
Where did you get all that money?

501
00:47:20,830 --> 00:47:23,030
- I have a lot of grandmothers.
- Oh.

502
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:25,300
Well, that explains it.

503
00:47:27,460 --> 00:47:31,860
This is a nice store. One of the
finer toy dealerships I've visited.

504
00:47:32,030 --> 00:47:33,060
Well, thank you.

505
00:47:33,300 --> 00:47:35,200
Mr. Duncan must be a nice guy...

506
00:47:35,430 --> 00:47:38,530
...letting kids come in here
and play with his toys.

507
00:47:38,770 --> 00:47:40,700
Most toy stores prohibit that.

508
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:42,070
- Is that so?
- Yes.

509
00:47:42,340 --> 00:47:44,540
Well, he loves kids.

510
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:48,940
As a matter of fact, all the money
the store takes in today...

511
00:47:49,210 --> 00:47:52,340
...Mr. Duncan is donating
to the Children's Hospital.

512
00:47:52,570 --> 00:47:54,670
And the day after Christmas...

513
00:47:54,840 --> 00:47:58,080
...we empty out all the money
in the cash register...

514
00:47:58,310 --> 00:48:01,440
...and Mr. Duncan takes it
right down to the hospital.

515
00:48:01,810 --> 00:48:03,110
That's generous of him.

516
00:48:03,310 --> 00:48:06,640
Well, children bring him
a lot of joy...

517
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:10,150
...as they do to everyone
who appreciates them.

518
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:20,850
I'm not supposed to spend this, but
I have $20 in a jar in our garage...

519
00:48:21,080 --> 00:48:24,950
...where my brother can't find it.
So I can pay my mother back.

520
00:48:25,220 --> 00:48:29,250
So give this to Mr. Duncan.
The hospital needs it more than I do.

521
00:48:29,490 --> 00:48:34,030
Besides, I'll probably spend it on
stuff that will rot my teeth and mind.

522
00:48:36,690 --> 00:48:40,190
Ah, that's...
That's very sweet of you.

523
00:48:41,060 --> 00:48:43,130
You see that tree there?

524
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:47,030
Well, to show our appreciation
for your generosity...

525
00:48:47,300 --> 00:48:49,900
...I'll let you select an object
from that tree...

526
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:53,270
...to take home with you.
- For free?

527
00:48:54,430 --> 00:48:57,400
- May I make a suggestion?
- Okay.

528
00:48:57,600 --> 00:48:59,730
Take the turtledoves.

529
00:49:00,370 --> 00:49:01,640
I can have two?

530
00:49:01,900 --> 00:49:06,270
Well, "two turtledoves. "
And I tell you what you do.

531
00:49:06,500 --> 00:49:08,110
You keep one...

532
00:49:08,510 --> 00:49:12,310
...and give the other one
to a very special person.

533
00:49:12,910 --> 00:49:14,810
You see, turtledoves...

534
00:49:15,270 --> 00:49:18,270
...are a symbol of friendship
and love.

535
00:49:18,610 --> 00:49:22,040
Now, as long as each of you
have your turtledove...

536
00:49:22,310 --> 00:49:24,880
...you'll be friends forever.

537
00:49:25,150 --> 00:49:29,310
Wow, I never knew that. I thought
they were just part of a song.

538
00:49:29,510 --> 00:49:33,280
They are. And for that
very special reason.

539
00:49:34,350 --> 00:49:35,350
Wow.

540
00:49:35,720 --> 00:49:36,720
Thanks.

541
00:49:36,950 --> 00:49:38,220
Merry Christmas.

542
00:49:38,420 --> 00:49:40,420
Merry Christmas to you too.

543
00:49:40,650 --> 00:49:43,490
Be sure to bundle up if you
go outside. It's nippy.

544
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:46,820
Oh. I'll do that.

545
00:50:22,840 --> 00:50:24,540
Well, where to?

546
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,840
You promised you'd take me
to the Central Park Zoo.

547
00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:38,910
Hey, look who it is.

548
00:50:42,510 --> 00:50:44,240
Come on, let's get him.

549
00:50:50,050 --> 00:50:51,280
Hi, pal.

550
00:51:10,890 --> 00:51:11,990
Come on.

551
00:51:27,530 --> 00:51:28,900
Hey!

552
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:35,600
Hey, watch it, man!

553
00:51:37,830 --> 00:51:42,270
Buy now and avoid the Christmas rush.
Two for $5. Two for $5.

554
00:51:42,740 --> 00:51:44,140
Four for 10.

555
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:45,770
There he is!

556
00:51:46,300 --> 00:51:47,440
All right.

557
00:51:48,370 --> 00:51:50,610
- Thanks.
- Merry Christmas, dude.

558
00:52:20,050 --> 00:52:21,620
Whoa!

559
00:52:24,420 --> 00:52:25,490
Oh...

560
00:52:26,950 --> 00:52:28,320
Yes!

561
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:32,060
Thank you for your suggestion.
My duty. My pleasure.

562
00:52:43,830 --> 00:52:46,130
Help! There's two guys after me!

563
00:52:46,700 --> 00:52:50,200
What's the matter?
Store wouldn't take your...

564
00:52:50,830 --> 00:52:52,830
...stolen credit card?

565
00:52:53,730 --> 00:52:56,700
Let's see what the police
have to say about this.

566
00:53:02,470 --> 00:53:04,200
Get up! Get up!

567
00:53:05,540 --> 00:53:07,140
Come on! Let's go get him.

568
00:53:09,270 --> 00:53:11,940
Get back here, you little thief!

569
00:53:14,840 --> 00:53:15,940
Stop that child!

570
00:53:19,810 --> 00:53:21,040
Grab him!

571
00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:27,810
Whoa!

572
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:37,720
You little sh...

573
00:53:39,790 --> 00:53:41,990
I've committed credit card fraud.

574
00:53:42,220 --> 00:53:44,150
Get me security!

575
00:53:44,420 --> 00:53:47,450
We've got to stop that delinquent!

576
00:53:47,720 --> 00:53:50,660
Come along, Cedric!

577
00:54:08,900 --> 00:54:12,200
I've had enough of this vacation.
I'm going home.

578
00:54:23,470 --> 00:54:24,440
{\i1}Hold it!{\i0}

579
00:54:26,670 --> 00:54:28,440
This is the Concierge, sir!

580
00:54:29,710 --> 00:54:31,440
{\i1}I knew it was you.{\i0}

581
00:54:31,670 --> 00:54:33,770
{\i1}I could smell you
getting off the elevator.{\i0}

582
00:54:36,510 --> 00:54:38,640
{\i1}You was here last night too,
wasn't you?{\i0}

583
00:54:40,910 --> 00:54:42,980
Yes, sir.

584
00:54:43,140 --> 00:54:44,040
I was.

585
00:54:44,680 --> 00:54:47,910
{\i1}You was here and you was smooching
with my brother.{\i0}

586
00:54:48,850 --> 00:54:50,520
Bu...

587
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:53,350
You're mistaken, sir.

588
00:54:54,080 --> 00:54:56,920
{\i1}Don't give me that.
You've smooched everybody.{\i0}

589
00:54:57,250 --> 00:55:01,620
{\i1}Snuffy, Al, Leo, Little Moe
with the gimpy leg...{\i0}

590
00:55:01,950 --> 00:55:04,090
{\i1}...Cheeks, Boney Bob, Cliff...{\i0}

591
00:55:07,190 --> 00:55:09,020
No!

592
00:55:10,790 --> 00:55:12,290
It's a lie!

593
00:55:12,520 --> 00:55:14,860
{\i1}I could go on forever, baby.{\i0}

594
00:55:15,390 --> 00:55:18,030
I'm terribly sorry, sir.

595
00:55:18,190 --> 00:55:19,830
I'm afraid you're mistaken.

596
00:55:20,490 --> 00:55:22,200
We're looking for a young man.

597
00:55:22,430 --> 00:55:24,900
{\i1}All right, I believe you...{\i0}

598
00:55:25,160 --> 00:55:26,590
{\i1}...but my Tommy gun don't.{\i0}

599
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:30,800
{\i1}Get down on your knees
and tell me you love me.{\i0}

600
00:55:34,070 --> 00:55:35,470
On your knees.

601
00:55:44,300 --> 00:55:46,700
I love you!

602
00:55:49,940 --> 00:55:51,640
{\i1}You gotta do better than that!{\i0}

603
00:55:53,370 --> 00:55:55,380
I love you!

604
00:55:57,240 --> 00:55:58,840
{\i1}Maybe I'm off my hinges...{\i0}

605
00:55:59,310 --> 00:56:00,340
{\i1}...but I believe you.{\i0}

606
00:56:00,580 --> 00:56:03,010
{\i1}That's why I'm gonna let you go.{\i0}

607
00:56:03,910 --> 00:56:07,880
{\i1}I'm gonna give you till the count
of three to get your lousy...{\i0}

608
00:56:08,380 --> 00:56:10,380
{\i1}...lying, low-down...{\i0}

609
00:56:10,580 --> 00:56:13,080
{\i1}...four-flushing carcass out my door!{\i0}

610
00:56:15,120 --> 00:56:16,380
{\i1}- One!
- Open the door!{\i0}

611
00:56:16,620 --> 00:56:17,450
{\i1}Two!{\i0}

612
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:33,520
{\i1}Three.{\i0}

613
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:36,990
{\i1}Merry Christmas, you filthy animal.{\i0}

614
00:56:39,530 --> 00:56:41,590
{\i1}And a happy new year.{\i0}

615
00:56:44,060 --> 00:56:46,900
Stay in your rooms!
This is an emergency!

616
00:56:47,560 --> 00:56:50,930
There's an insane guest with a gun!

617
00:57:01,370 --> 00:57:02,770
No!

618
00:57:06,110 --> 00:57:08,010
Come to Papa!

619
00:57:09,970 --> 00:57:13,670
Round trip to Miami. What's the
matter, get on the wrong plane?

620
00:57:13,910 --> 00:57:15,680
You won't be needing this.

621
00:57:15,910 --> 00:57:20,110
American don't fly to the
promised land, little buddy.

622
00:57:22,050 --> 00:57:26,210
We spent 9 months in jail thinking
we had the worst luck in the universe.

623
00:57:26,440 --> 00:57:27,880
We were wrong.

624
00:57:28,110 --> 00:57:31,610
We busted out and we're doing fine.
Even better...

625
00:57:31,880 --> 00:57:35,320
...because we're not robbing houses,
we're robbing toy stores.

626
00:57:35,480 --> 00:57:38,650
At midnight tonight,
we'll hit Duncan's Toy Chest.

627
00:57:38,850 --> 00:57:40,590
Five floors of cash.

628
00:57:40,790 --> 00:57:44,390
Then after that, we grab some
phony passports and go to Rio.

629
00:57:44,650 --> 00:57:48,450
- You want to shut up?
- He's not gonna talk to anybody.

630
00:57:48,690 --> 00:57:50,690
Except maybe a fish.

631
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:51,990
Or the undertaker.

632
00:57:52,220 --> 00:57:57,230
Let's go to the subway tunnel.
I'll feel better once I get him on ice.

633
00:57:59,360 --> 00:58:00,590
I've got a gun.

634
00:58:00,860 --> 00:58:04,530
Say anything and you'll be spitting
gum out through your forehead.

635
00:58:25,340 --> 00:58:26,140
Well, hello.

636
00:58:30,140 --> 00:58:31,140
He did it!

637
00:58:31,910 --> 00:58:32,940
Did what?

638
00:58:35,870 --> 00:58:37,240
Thanks!

639
00:58:40,440 --> 00:58:42,480
Go get him.
He went in the park.

640
00:58:42,710 --> 00:58:44,550
What are you doing flirting?!

641
00:59:20,360 --> 00:59:21,430
Over there!

642
00:59:28,130 --> 00:59:29,960
Don't!
Give it!

643
00:59:31,330 --> 00:59:32,160
Hey, Harry.

644
00:59:32,760 --> 00:59:34,030
- I got him.
- Let me see!

645
00:59:34,300 --> 00:59:37,170
That ain't him! Put him down.
That ain't him.

646
00:59:37,830 --> 00:59:42,200
We should've shot him. I hate pulling
a job, knowing that creep's loose.

647
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:45,900
- What can he do? Kids are helpless.
- Not this kid.

648
00:59:46,170 --> 00:59:50,570
But this time he doesn't have a house
full of dangerous goodies.

649
00:59:50,770 --> 00:59:54,570
He's in the park. He's alone.
Kids are scared of the park.

650
00:59:54,770 --> 00:59:58,780
Yeah. Grown men come in the park
and don't leave alive.

651
01:00:00,080 --> 01:00:01,880
Good luck, little fella.

652
01:00:12,850 --> 01:00:14,510
{\i1}I want to go home.{\i0}

653
01:00:15,350 --> 01:00:17,280
{\i1}Mom, where are you?{\i0}

654
01:00:46,960 --> 01:00:48,300
Turn that down!

655
01:00:50,630 --> 01:00:51,660
{\i1}- Hello?
Kate McCallister.{\i0}

656
01:00:51,930 --> 01:00:53,470
{\i1}- This is she.
- We found him.{\i0}

657
01:00:53,700 --> 01:00:55,200
- Oh, my God!
- What?

658
01:00:55,370 --> 01:00:57,330
- They know where Kevin is.
- Where?

659
01:00:57,570 --> 01:00:59,570
{\i1}- He's in New York City.
- New York!{\i0}

660
01:00:59,800 --> 01:01:01,040
New York?

661
01:01:02,770 --> 01:01:03,740
What?

662
01:01:04,440 --> 01:01:07,540
- He's scared, he's not a troublemaker.
- What? What?

663
01:01:07,770 --> 01:01:11,870
Just a second. He used your credit
card to check into the Plaza Hotel.

664
01:01:12,910 --> 01:01:14,610
- Do they have him?
- Is he there?

665
01:01:14,780 --> 01:01:17,070
{\i1}- No, they're still looking.
- Damn it!{\i0}

666
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:19,780
{\i1}- Get to New York.
- We're on the next flight out.{\i0}

667
01:01:20,010 --> 01:01:22,310
Thanks.
We're going to New York, move it!

668
01:01:22,510 --> 01:01:23,780
Yes!

669
01:01:25,080 --> 01:01:28,950
He ran away when they asked about
the card. He must be scared!

670
01:01:29,450 --> 01:01:32,380
- Would he go to my brother's?
- Aren't they in Paris?

671
01:01:32,810 --> 01:01:36,250
- Maybe they have a housesitter.
- Aren't they renovating?

672
01:02:16,230 --> 01:02:17,730
Hello?!

673
01:02:18,670 --> 01:02:21,400
Uncle Rob! Aunt Georgette!

674
01:02:21,670 --> 01:02:23,570
Anybody home?!

675
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:25,470
Hello!

676
01:02:26,040 --> 01:02:27,640
Anybody home?

677
01:02:27,940 --> 01:02:30,640
It's me, your favorite nephew, Kevin!

678
01:02:31,240 --> 01:02:32,970
Uncle Rob!

679
01:02:33,140 --> 01:02:34,770
Aunt Georgette!

680
01:03:18,260 --> 01:03:20,330
Watch it, kid!

681
01:03:26,860 --> 01:03:30,060
You looking for someone
to read you a bedtime story?

682
01:03:36,100 --> 01:03:37,500
Taxi!

683
01:03:50,410 --> 01:03:52,610
It's scary out there.

684
01:03:54,340 --> 01:03:55,670
Ain't much better in here.

685
01:04:23,390 --> 01:04:26,250
I don't ever want to take a vacation
like this again.

686
01:04:57,130 --> 01:04:58,470
Where did you come from?

687
01:04:58,770 --> 01:05:00,540
I don't have enough for everybody.

688
01:05:00,870 --> 01:05:03,130
How hungry are you guys?

689
01:05:04,770 --> 01:05:06,840
You guys ate all my food.

690
01:06:06,160 --> 01:06:10,900
I'm sorry I screamed in your face.
You were trying to help me, right?

691
01:06:14,570 --> 01:06:16,400
I'm Kevin McCallister.

692
01:06:17,270 --> 01:06:18,730
Your birds are real nice.

693
01:06:20,070 --> 01:06:21,430
I've seen you before.

694
01:06:21,670 --> 01:06:23,770
You had pigeons all over you.

695
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:28,300
At first, you look scary, but when
I think about it, it's not so bad.

696
01:06:28,600 --> 01:06:31,140
They must like you to be all over you.

697
01:06:32,870 --> 01:06:35,240
If I'm bothering you, I can leave.

698
01:06:35,510 --> 01:06:36,910
Am I bothering you?

699
01:06:38,410 --> 01:06:39,710
No.

700
01:06:40,640 --> 01:06:42,940
Good. I'm not a pain in the butt?

701
01:06:45,280 --> 01:06:46,510
No.

702
01:06:51,010 --> 01:06:53,910
Will the pigeons come back
on their own or do you call them?

703
01:07:05,620 --> 01:07:06,490
Give me your hand.

704
01:07:10,990 --> 01:07:12,620
They can hear it.

705
01:07:29,900 --> 01:07:31,130
This is great!

706
01:07:35,430 --> 01:07:36,900
It's pretty cold out.

707
01:07:37,130 --> 01:07:40,800
I'd sure like a cup of hot chocolate.
How about you?

708
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:41,840
My treat.

709
01:07:46,800 --> 01:07:49,470
I'd hate to spend Christmas Eve
in such a park.

710
01:07:49,710 --> 01:07:51,700
Can we go someplace warm?

711
01:07:52,040 --> 01:07:53,040
Yes.

712
01:07:53,200 --> 01:07:54,670
I know a place.

713
01:08:41,630 --> 01:08:43,530
Nice music.

714
01:08:44,960 --> 01:08:47,060
This place is great.

715
01:08:47,430 --> 01:08:50,260
I've heard the world's
great music from here.

716
01:08:52,100 --> 01:08:54,330
Ella Fitzgerald. Count Basie.

717
01:08:54,600 --> 01:08:56,300
Frank Sinatra.

718
01:08:56,600 --> 01:08:58,770
Luciano Pavarotti.

719
01:09:03,930 --> 01:09:05,700
Do you bring your friends here?

720
01:09:07,970 --> 01:09:09,470
I haven't got many friends.

721
01:09:10,570 --> 01:09:11,840
Sorry.

722
01:09:12,570 --> 01:09:14,710
I'm like the birds I care for.

723
01:09:15,670 --> 01:09:19,780
People pass me in the street.
They see me but they try to ignore me.

724
01:09:20,040 --> 01:09:22,110
They prefer I wasn't in their city.

725
01:09:22,640 --> 01:09:27,610
Yeah. It's like that with my family.
I'm like the pigeon of the house...

726
01:09:27,780 --> 01:09:29,310
...just because I'm the youngest.

727
01:09:30,250 --> 01:09:32,310
Everyone fights for position.

728
01:09:32,680 --> 01:09:34,320
Everyone wants to be seen...

729
01:09:34,650 --> 01:09:35,580
...and heard.

730
01:09:36,120 --> 01:09:37,180
I guess so.

731
01:09:37,450 --> 01:09:41,950
I'm seen and heard pretty much.
But I get sent to my room a lot too.

732
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:47,020
I wasn't always like this.

733
01:09:47,650 --> 01:09:49,660
What were you like before?

734
01:09:50,360 --> 01:09:52,920
I had a job. I had a home.

735
01:09:53,560 --> 01:09:55,760
- I had a family.
- Any kids?

736
01:09:57,290 --> 01:09:58,460
No.

737
01:09:59,360 --> 01:10:01,030
I wanted them.

738
01:10:01,690 --> 01:10:05,160
But the man I loved
fell out of love with me.

739
01:10:06,130 --> 01:10:07,300
That broke my heart.

740
01:10:08,230 --> 01:10:10,760
When the chance
to be loved came along again...

741
01:10:11,800 --> 01:10:13,700
...I ran away from it.

742
01:10:14,360 --> 01:10:16,170
I stopped trusting people.

743
01:10:16,700 --> 01:10:20,530
No offense, but that seems like
sort of a dumb thing to do.

744
01:10:20,970 --> 01:10:23,700
I was afraid of getting
my heart broken again.

745
01:10:24,340 --> 01:10:26,800
Sometimes you can trust a person...

746
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:30,770
...and then, when things are down,
they forget about you.

747
01:10:31,740 --> 01:10:33,510
Maybe they're just too busy.

748
01:10:33,770 --> 01:10:37,480
Maybe they don't forget about you,
but they forget to remember you.

749
01:10:37,740 --> 01:10:39,640
People don't mean to forget.

750
01:10:39,810 --> 01:10:41,580
My grandfather says...

751
01:10:41,810 --> 01:10:46,080
...if my head wasn't screwed on,
I'd leave it on the school bus.

752
01:10:46,610 --> 01:10:50,310
I'm just afraid if I do trust someone,
I'll get my heart broken.

753
01:10:50,780 --> 01:10:51,850
I understand.

754
01:10:52,280 --> 01:10:54,650
I had a nice pair of Rollerblades.

755
01:10:54,880 --> 01:10:57,120
I was afraid to wreck them...

756
01:10:57,380 --> 01:11:01,080
...so I kept them in a box.
Do you know what happened?

757
01:11:01,380 --> 01:11:06,190
I outgrew them. I never wore them
outside. Only in my room a few times.

758
01:11:07,690 --> 01:11:11,290
A person's heart and feelings
are very different than skates.

759
01:11:12,120 --> 01:11:14,190
They're kind of the same thing.

760
01:11:14,420 --> 01:11:17,490
If you won't use your heart,
who cares if it gets broken?

761
01:11:18,090 --> 01:11:21,730
If you just keep it to yourself,
maybe it'll be like my Rollerblades.

762
01:11:22,090 --> 01:11:25,430
When you do decide to try it,
it won't be any good.

763
01:11:25,660 --> 01:11:28,430
You should take a chance.
Got nothing to lose.

764
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:31,830
Little truth in there somewhere.

765
01:11:32,100 --> 01:11:36,500
I think so. Your heart might
still be broken, but it isn't gone.

766
01:11:36,730 --> 01:11:39,030
If it was gone,
you wouldn't be so nice.

767
01:11:40,470 --> 01:11:41,630
Thank you.

768
01:11:43,870 --> 01:11:45,770
Do you know it's been...

769
01:11:46,870 --> 01:11:49,840
...a couple of years
since I've talked to anybody?

770
01:11:50,210 --> 01:11:52,100
That's okay. You're good at it.

771
01:11:52,370 --> 01:11:54,970
You're not boring.
You don't mumble or spit.

772
01:11:55,270 --> 01:11:56,940
You should do it more often.

773
01:11:57,240 --> 01:12:00,470
Just wear an outfit
with no pigeon poop on it.

774
01:12:03,940 --> 01:12:07,180
I have been working very hard
at keeping people away.

775
01:12:07,480 --> 01:12:10,010
I always think I'll have
a lot of fun if I'm alone...

776
01:12:10,280 --> 01:12:12,610
...but when I'm alone, it's not fun.

777
01:12:13,180 --> 01:12:15,820
I don't care how much people bug me...

778
01:12:15,980 --> 01:12:18,480
...I'd rather be with someone
than alone.

779
01:12:19,520 --> 01:12:22,480
So what are you doing alone
on Christmas Eve?

780
01:12:23,020 --> 01:12:24,450
Did you get into trouble?

781
01:12:25,450 --> 01:12:26,420
Yeah.

782
01:12:26,620 --> 01:12:28,090
You did something wrong?

783
01:12:28,350 --> 01:12:29,720
A lot of things.

784
01:12:32,190 --> 01:12:35,790
Did you know that a good deed
erases a bad deed?

785
01:12:36,120 --> 01:12:38,790
It's late. I don't know
if I'll have enough time...

786
01:12:39,090 --> 01:12:42,030
...to do enough good deeds
to erase all my bad ones.

787
01:12:42,430 --> 01:12:45,660
It's Christmas Eve.
Good deeds count extra tonight.

788
01:12:45,930 --> 01:12:48,590
- They do?
- Of course they do.

789
01:12:48,830 --> 01:12:52,630
Think of an important
thing you can do for others...

790
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:54,300
...and go do it.

791
01:12:54,970 --> 01:12:57,700
Just follow the star in your heart.

792
01:12:59,600 --> 01:13:00,770
Okay.

793
01:13:01,700 --> 01:13:04,370
It's getting pretty late.
I'd better get going.

794
01:13:11,610 --> 01:13:14,970
If I don't see you, I hope
everything turns out okay.

795
01:13:15,310 --> 01:13:16,810
Thank you.

796
01:13:17,340 --> 01:13:19,070
Tell the birds I said goodbye.

797
01:13:19,340 --> 01:13:20,640
I will.

798
01:13:28,950 --> 01:13:30,050
Merry Christmas.

799
01:13:30,380 --> 01:13:31,510
Merry Christmas.

800
01:13:31,910 --> 01:13:35,180
If you need somebody to trust,
it can be me.

801
01:13:35,410 --> 01:13:37,310
I won't forget to remember you.

802
01:13:38,350 --> 01:13:40,920
Don't make promises you can't keep.

803
01:14:39,840 --> 01:14:41,710
{\i1}All the money in the registers...{\i0}

804
01:14:41,940 --> 01:14:45,440
{\i1}...Mr. Duncan is gonna donate
to the Children's Hospital.{\i0}

805
01:14:46,040 --> 01:14:49,710
{\i1}At midnight tonight,
we're hitting Duncan's Toy Chest.{\i0}

806
01:14:50,010 --> 01:14:54,910
You can mess with a lot of things, but
you can't mess with kids on Christmas.

807
01:17:15,410 --> 01:17:18,470
We'd like to offer you
a complimentary suite.

808
01:17:19,140 --> 01:17:21,680
It's a penthouse
with a view of the park.

809
01:17:21,910 --> 01:17:26,410
I think you'll find it satisfactory.
It was recently vacated by a countess.

810
01:17:27,040 --> 01:17:29,880
What kind of hotel lets a child
check in alone?

811
01:17:30,180 --> 01:17:32,380
The boy had a very convincing story.

812
01:17:32,750 --> 01:17:34,880
What kind of idiots work here?

813
01:17:35,580 --> 01:17:37,650
The finest in New York.

814
01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:40,780
When you learned the credit card...

815
01:17:41,120 --> 01:17:42,990
I made the discovery.

816
01:17:43,250 --> 01:17:44,580
Why did you let him leave?

817
01:17:45,520 --> 01:17:47,590
We confronted him and he ran!

818
01:17:47,820 --> 01:17:48,820
You scared him!

819
01:17:49,150 --> 01:17:53,490
It's Christmas Eve, and because of you,
our child is lost in a huge city.

820
01:17:57,520 --> 01:17:59,860
Take our family and luggage
up to the room.

821
01:18:00,090 --> 01:18:01,160
Yes, sir!

822
01:18:01,360 --> 01:18:02,760
Run along, Cedric.

823
01:18:03,230 --> 01:18:06,630
I'll go to the police station to make
sure they're looking for Kevin.

824
01:18:06,890 --> 01:18:08,630
I want you to stay here.

825
01:18:08,890 --> 01:18:11,030
- I'm going to look for him.
- What?

826
01:18:11,230 --> 01:18:15,300
With all due respect, your son is lost
in one of the world's biggest cities.

827
01:18:16,630 --> 01:18:18,430
Could you stay out of this?

828
01:18:19,100 --> 01:18:20,130
As you wish.

829
01:18:20,630 --> 01:18:25,440
Thank you. It's not a good idea
to run around New York City alone.

830
01:18:25,600 --> 01:18:27,270
If Kevin can, so can I.

831
01:18:27,540 --> 01:18:28,600
- Kate...
- I'll be fine.

832
01:18:28,840 --> 01:18:31,740
The way I feel, no mugger
or murderer would mess with me.

833
01:18:33,970 --> 01:18:37,310
There are hundreds of armed
parasites out there!

834
01:18:39,370 --> 01:18:42,110
Do bundle up.
It's awfully cold outside.

835
01:19:16,890 --> 01:19:17,990
Marv. Marv.

836
01:19:18,220 --> 01:19:19,920
Come on, let's go.

837
01:19:40,630 --> 01:19:41,700
Marv.

838
01:19:41,970 --> 01:19:43,700
Crowbars up!

839
01:19:49,570 --> 01:19:51,570
Merry Christmas, Harry!

840
01:19:55,740 --> 01:19:58,210
Happy Hanukkah, Marv!

841
01:20:07,880 --> 01:20:10,750
This is more money
than I can even count!

842
01:20:10,980 --> 01:20:15,180
It makes you wonder why we spent
so much time robbing homes.

843
01:20:28,820 --> 01:20:31,720
The amazing thing is,
we're fugitives from the law...

844
01:20:31,920 --> 01:20:35,960
...we're up to our elbows in cash
and nobody even knows about it.

845
01:20:40,520 --> 01:20:41,930
He's back!

846
01:20:43,390 --> 01:20:44,590
He took our picture!

847
01:20:44,830 --> 01:20:46,130
How was my hair?

848
01:20:52,330 --> 01:20:55,830
This is it. No turning back.

849
01:20:56,260 --> 01:20:58,770
Another Christmas in the trenches.

850
01:21:00,270 --> 01:21:01,730
No!

851
01:21:07,700 --> 01:21:08,640
Wow.

852
01:21:08,870 --> 01:21:11,040
That's it! Get the money!
Get it!

853
01:21:17,070 --> 01:21:18,410
I'll kill him!

854
01:21:20,910 --> 01:21:22,940
- Marv!
- I'm coming, Harry!

855
01:21:32,150 --> 01:21:33,450
Harry?

856
01:21:36,280 --> 01:21:37,520
Harry!

857
01:21:38,120 --> 01:21:39,180
That was incredible.

858
01:21:42,980 --> 01:21:45,720
- I twisted my ankle.
- Where is he?

859
01:21:45,990 --> 01:21:48,190
Hey, guys! Smile!

860
01:21:50,890 --> 01:21:52,120
Come on! Come on!

861
01:21:52,620 --> 01:21:54,290
- Help me.
- I got you.

862
01:21:54,720 --> 01:21:56,090
I got you.

863
01:22:23,340 --> 01:22:24,870
Taxi!

864
01:22:30,270 --> 01:22:31,840
Times Square!

865
01:22:53,680 --> 01:22:55,050
Where'd he go?

866
01:22:56,180 --> 01:22:57,750
I'm up here! Come get me!

867
01:23:00,420 --> 01:23:01,480
Let's kill!

868
01:23:01,680 --> 01:23:03,380
Hold on, pea-brain.

869
01:23:03,650 --> 01:23:07,390
We got busted because we underestimated
that bundle of misery.

870
01:23:07,620 --> 01:23:08,890
This ain't like that.

871
01:23:09,390 --> 01:23:13,590
This ain't his house. The kid's
running scared. He ain't got a plan.

872
01:23:14,090 --> 01:23:16,760
May I do the thinking, please?

873
01:23:17,920 --> 01:23:19,090
Thank you.

874
01:23:21,420 --> 01:23:22,260
Sonny!

875
01:23:22,620 --> 01:23:23,860
Yes?

876
01:23:24,160 --> 01:23:27,830
Nothing would thrill me
more greatly than to shoot you.

877
01:23:28,330 --> 01:23:31,460
Knocking off a youngster
won't mean that much to me.

878
01:23:31,700 --> 01:23:33,060
- Understand?
- Mm-hm.

879
01:23:33,560 --> 01:23:37,060
But since we're in a hurry,
I'll make a deal with you.

880
01:23:37,460 --> 01:23:41,200
You throw down your camera
and we won't hurt you.

881
01:23:42,170 --> 01:23:46,000
You'll never hear from us again.
Okay?

882
01:23:46,270 --> 01:23:47,300
Promise?

883
01:23:48,140 --> 01:23:51,570
I cross my heart and hope to die.

884
01:23:52,400 --> 01:23:54,040
Okay!

885
01:23:59,440 --> 01:24:00,780
Okay, kid...

886
01:24:01,240 --> 01:24:02,780
...give it to me.

887
01:24:11,110 --> 01:24:12,080
Direct hit!

888
01:24:18,150 --> 01:24:20,280
How many fingers am I holding up?

889
01:24:22,950 --> 01:24:24,020
Eight?

890
01:24:27,450 --> 01:24:31,320
Okay, kid. You want to throw bricks?
Go ahead, throw another one.

891
01:24:31,820 --> 01:24:33,420
Don't do that!

892
01:24:37,020 --> 01:24:40,460
If you can't do any better than that,
you're going to lose.

893
01:24:42,030 --> 01:24:43,590
Harry...

894
01:24:43,990 --> 01:24:45,030
...no.

895
01:24:51,400 --> 01:24:53,400
You got any more?

896
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:58,430
Get up.
He don't have any more bricks.

897
01:25:05,600 --> 01:25:06,770
What?

898
01:25:08,600 --> 01:25:09,870
What?

899
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:13,470
What?

900
01:25:16,240 --> 01:25:20,040
That did it! Nobody throws bricks
at me and gets away with it. Come on!

901
01:25:20,310 --> 01:25:22,610
You go this way. I'll go around back.

902
01:25:26,910 --> 01:25:28,640
Harry?

903
01:25:29,980 --> 01:25:31,750
Harry?

904
01:25:32,580 --> 01:25:35,080
Harry?

905
01:25:58,290 --> 01:25:59,490
Huh?

906
01:28:00,470 --> 01:28:01,840
Harry!

907
01:28:02,170 --> 01:28:04,140
I reached the top!

908
01:28:18,780 --> 01:28:19,950
Ahh.

909
01:28:56,430 --> 01:28:58,770
You better do better than this.

910
01:29:23,510 --> 01:29:25,010
Wow!

911
01:29:25,240 --> 01:29:27,080
What a hole!

912
01:29:48,390 --> 01:29:49,390
Whoa!

913
01:30:06,560 --> 01:30:07,390
Uh-oh.

914
01:30:35,870 --> 01:30:36,840
Ah!

915
01:33:34,550 --> 01:33:36,350
Harry.

916
01:33:56,990 --> 01:33:58,820
I'm coming up!

917
01:34:04,460 --> 01:34:05,960
Uh-oh.

918
01:34:13,530 --> 01:34:15,830
I'm gonna murder that kid!

919
01:34:33,800 --> 01:34:35,070
Yes!

920
01:34:42,070 --> 01:34:43,340
Whoa.

921
01:34:52,010 --> 01:34:54,510
Whoa, whoa!

922
01:35:05,020 --> 01:35:06,220
Hey!

923
01:35:06,520 --> 01:35:09,350
Don't you know a kid always wins
against two idiots?

924
01:35:09,590 --> 01:35:11,820
Harry! In the living room!

925
01:35:13,460 --> 01:35:14,990
He went up the ladder!

926
01:35:30,030 --> 01:35:31,630
Oh.

927
01:35:32,630 --> 01:35:34,330
I'm coming, Harry.

928
01:35:34,860 --> 01:35:36,030
I'm coming.

929
01:35:41,230 --> 01:35:42,430
Harry!

930
01:35:44,470 --> 01:35:48,300
You didn't lose any teeth!
Come on, he went to the second floor.

931
01:35:48,800 --> 01:35:49,730
Hey!

932
01:35:49,930 --> 01:35:51,270
Try the stairs.

933
01:35:52,100 --> 01:35:53,610
Right.

934
01:35:56,470 --> 01:35:58,270
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

935
01:35:58,640 --> 01:35:59,970
Remember last year?

936
01:36:01,310 --> 01:36:02,140
No.

937
01:36:02,710 --> 01:36:04,540
Watch this.

938
01:36:05,010 --> 01:36:06,840
Let's get him!

939
01:36:10,910 --> 01:36:11,810
Ow!

940
01:36:12,040 --> 01:36:15,180
He busted me right in my mouth, Marv!

941
01:36:15,580 --> 01:36:16,580
That's one.

942
01:36:17,380 --> 01:36:18,910
Don't worry, Harry.

943
01:36:20,110 --> 01:36:21,920
I'll get him.

944
01:36:26,650 --> 01:36:27,650
Ow!

945
01:36:28,550 --> 01:36:30,790
Right in the schnoz.

946
01:36:31,790 --> 01:36:32,950
That's two.

947
01:36:33,220 --> 01:36:34,690
Come on, let's get him.

948
01:36:37,760 --> 01:36:38,620
Oops.

949
01:36:46,560 --> 01:36:47,830
That's...

950
01:36:48,060 --> 01:36:49,390
...three.

951
01:36:55,200 --> 01:36:56,330
No.

952
01:36:58,530 --> 01:37:00,530
That's four.

953
01:37:05,400 --> 01:37:08,500
- Come on, Harry.
- Marv, are you sure this is safe?

954
01:37:09,770 --> 01:37:11,940
I've worked all the kinks out.

955
01:37:12,170 --> 01:37:13,670
Solid as a rock.

956
01:37:30,740 --> 01:37:32,950
Like a rock, huh?

957
01:37:33,210 --> 01:37:34,110
Give up?

958
01:37:34,450 --> 01:37:37,720
Have you had enough pain?
- Never!

959
01:37:48,990 --> 01:37:51,750
You better say every prayer
you ever heard!

960
01:37:51,950 --> 01:37:54,520
I hope your parents got you
a tombstone for Christmas.

961
01:37:57,320 --> 01:37:58,660
Where'd he go?

962
01:37:58,890 --> 01:38:01,520
I'm up here and I'm really scared.

963
01:38:11,430 --> 01:38:13,200
What's that sound?

964
01:38:33,140 --> 01:38:35,640
That was the sound of a tool chest...

965
01:38:35,870 --> 01:38:38,370
...falling down the stairs.

966
01:38:38,540 --> 01:38:39,810
Oh.

967
01:38:44,310 --> 01:38:45,840
Yes!

968
01:39:20,860 --> 01:39:22,220
Over there!

969
01:39:22,590 --> 01:39:25,430
Even if I get the chair,
I'm killing that kid!

970
01:39:28,190 --> 01:39:29,760
Surrender, kid!

971
01:39:30,400 --> 01:39:31,200
He vanished.

972
01:39:31,430 --> 01:39:33,230
I'm here, you horse's ass!

973
01:39:37,300 --> 01:39:38,130
Whoa.

974
01:39:38,400 --> 01:39:39,830
Nice night for a neck injury!

975
01:39:41,630 --> 01:39:44,270
Suck brick, kid!

976
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:51,940
Come on, Marv.

977
01:39:52,340 --> 01:39:53,240
I don't know.

978
01:39:53,500 --> 01:39:55,410
I said, come on!

979
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:59,210
Come on, you big sissy.

980
01:40:13,250 --> 01:40:15,810
Harry? You wearing aftershave?

981
01:40:16,150 --> 01:40:17,810
That's kerosene.

982
01:40:18,610 --> 01:40:20,910
The rope is soaked in it.

983
01:40:21,150 --> 01:40:23,680
Why would anyone soak a rope
in kerosene?

984
01:40:28,650 --> 01:40:30,720
Merry Christmas.

985
01:40:30,890 --> 01:40:31,790
Go up!

986
01:41:07,430 --> 01:41:09,040
Get off me!

987
01:41:32,250 --> 01:41:33,750
Get the bag!

988
01:41:34,480 --> 01:41:37,580
Two guys who robbed Duncan's Toy Chest
are in the park.

989
01:41:37,810 --> 01:41:42,680
Central Park West, 95th Street. Look
for fireworks. Hurry, they got a gun.

990
01:41:49,120 --> 01:41:50,150
I'm here.

991
01:41:50,390 --> 01:41:53,420
Better come and get me
before I call the cops.

992
01:42:00,860 --> 01:42:02,030
Whoa!

993
01:42:08,460 --> 01:42:11,230
My, how the tables have turned.

994
01:42:11,490 --> 01:42:12,930
How do you like the ice?

995
01:42:18,660 --> 01:42:21,700
Let's go for a little stroll
in the park.

996
01:42:38,840 --> 01:42:39,770
Give me the bag.

997
01:42:40,070 --> 01:42:41,570
Give me it!

998
01:42:46,440 --> 01:42:48,580
Great for the album.

999
01:42:49,580 --> 01:42:53,240
You may've won the battle, dude,
but you lost the war.

1000
01:42:54,110 --> 01:42:56,080
You ought not of messed with us.

1001
01:42:56,510 --> 01:42:57,510
We're dangerous.

1002
01:43:03,980 --> 01:43:05,650
- Harry?
- Shut up!

1003
01:43:10,320 --> 01:43:11,190
Harry.

1004
01:43:11,650 --> 01:43:13,950
Shut up! I want to enjoy this.

1005
01:43:14,890 --> 01:43:16,520
Something's wrong.

1006
01:43:17,120 --> 01:43:19,220
- Let's get out of here!
- Shut up!

1007
01:43:21,420 --> 01:43:23,460
I never made it to the 6th grade...

1008
01:43:24,420 --> 01:43:27,430
...and it doesn't look like
you're gonna either.

1009
01:43:28,490 --> 01:43:29,960
Let him go!

1010
01:43:30,300 --> 01:43:31,630
Kevin, run!

1011
01:43:33,530 --> 01:43:34,930
Shoot her!

1012
01:43:35,130 --> 01:43:36,800
Shoot her!

1013
01:43:37,030 --> 01:43:38,960
- Shoot her!
- I'm trying!

1014
01:44:19,150 --> 01:44:20,220
Bye! Thanks.

1015
01:44:46,920 --> 01:44:49,530
Jesus, looks like the 4th of July!

1016
01:44:50,290 --> 01:44:52,200
We got the bridge.
Take the tunnel.

1017
01:44:52,430 --> 01:44:53,830
Let's go, let's go!

1018
01:45:01,730 --> 01:45:03,200
Oh, my God!

1019
01:45:13,970 --> 01:45:15,240
All right, let's go.

1020
01:45:15,470 --> 01:45:17,200
Come on, on your feet.

1021
01:45:21,940 --> 01:45:26,710
You guys should've started earlier.
The prisoners already exchanged gifts.

1022
01:45:26,980 --> 01:45:28,540
We missed the presents?

1023
01:45:28,810 --> 01:45:32,380
He made us hide in the store
and steal the kiddies' charity money.

1024
01:45:32,650 --> 01:45:34,510
Shut up, Marv.

1025
01:45:36,410 --> 01:45:38,510
You've got the right to remain silent.

1026
01:45:38,910 --> 01:45:41,850
He's a little cranky.
We just broke out of prison.

1027
01:45:42,080 --> 01:45:43,920
Shut up, Marv!

1028
01:45:45,050 --> 01:45:46,750
Get them out of here!

1029
01:45:47,020 --> 01:45:48,520
If this makes the papers...

1030
01:45:48,750 --> 01:45:52,290
...we're no longer the Wet Bandits,
we're the Sticky Bandits.

1031
01:45:53,320 --> 01:45:54,550
That's sticky. S...

1032
01:45:55,660 --> 01:45:57,090
...T...

1033
01:45:57,650 --> 01:45:59,260
I.
I.

1034
01:46:11,360 --> 01:46:14,900
It's all over. We apprehended
the thieves and got your money.

1035
01:46:15,200 --> 01:46:18,530
I want to get that money
over to the Children's Hospital.

1036
01:46:18,730 --> 01:46:21,400
I'll handle it.
Thank you.

1037
01:46:22,270 --> 01:46:23,500
Excuse me.

1038
01:46:23,830 --> 01:46:27,400
I found this note. Looks like
a kid broke your window.

1039
01:46:28,100 --> 01:46:29,400
{\i1}Dear Mr. Duncan:{\i0}

1040
01:46:29,640 --> 01:46:32,470
{\i1}I broke your window
to catch the bad guys.{\i0}

1041
01:46:32,740 --> 01:46:34,170
{\i1}Do you have insurance?{\i0}

1042
01:46:34,440 --> 01:46:37,910
{\i1}If not, I'll send you some money,
if I ever get home.{\i0}

1043
01:46:38,140 --> 01:46:40,110
{\i1}Merry Christmas.
Kevin McCallister.{\i0}

1044
01:46:40,440 --> 01:46:43,140
{\i1}P. S. Thanks for the turtledoves.{\i0}

1045
01:46:44,340 --> 01:46:46,010
Turtledoves.

1046
01:46:47,170 --> 01:46:48,340
Oh.

1047
01:46:55,680 --> 01:46:58,350
Excuse me. I'm looking for my son.
This boy here.

1048
01:47:01,220 --> 01:47:05,120
Please help me. This boy right here.
Have you seen him?

1049
01:47:14,290 --> 01:47:17,690
I'm looking for my son.
He's been missing for two days.

1050
01:47:17,950 --> 01:47:20,790
- Have you filed a report?
- Of course we have.

1051
01:47:22,720 --> 01:47:25,360
Then trust us. We'll handle it.

1052
01:47:27,160 --> 01:47:28,360
Oh.

1053
01:47:30,460 --> 01:47:31,430
I'm his mother.

1054
01:47:33,160 --> 01:47:35,830
I know, but you're looking
for a needle in a haystack.

1055
01:47:37,330 --> 01:47:38,400
Do you have kids?

1056
01:47:39,800 --> 01:47:40,630
Yes, ma'am.

1057
01:47:40,930 --> 01:47:42,630
What if one was missing?

1058
01:47:45,230 --> 01:47:47,740
I'd probably do the same thing
you're doing.

1059
01:47:49,070 --> 01:47:50,130
Thank you.

1060
01:47:52,940 --> 01:47:54,740
Put yourself in his shoes.

1061
01:47:55,140 --> 01:47:57,100
What would you do?

1062
01:47:57,270 --> 01:48:00,710
Me? I'd probably be lying dead
in a gutter somewhere.

1063
01:48:02,140 --> 01:48:03,540
But not Kevin.

1064
01:48:03,810 --> 01:48:07,410
No. Kevin is so much stronger
and braver than I am.

1065
01:48:08,380 --> 01:48:11,010
I know Kevin's fine. I'm sure he is.

1066
01:48:12,580 --> 01:48:15,250
But he's still alone in a big city.

1067
01:48:16,110 --> 01:48:17,950
He doesn't deserve that.

1068
01:48:18,210 --> 01:48:22,650
He deserves to be at home with his own
family around his Christmas tree.

1069
01:48:26,280 --> 01:48:27,650
Oh, dear God...

1070
01:48:28,580 --> 01:48:30,120
...I know where he is.

1071
01:48:30,820 --> 01:48:33,420
I need to get to Rockefeller Center.

1072
01:48:33,690 --> 01:48:35,960
- Hop in.
- Thank you.

1073
01:48:40,220 --> 01:48:44,390
I know I don't deserve a Christmas
even if I did do a good deed.

1074
01:48:45,360 --> 01:48:46,890
I don't want any presents.

1075
01:48:47,230 --> 01:48:51,230
Instead, I want to take back every mean
thing I ever said to my family...

1076
01:48:51,430 --> 01:48:53,700
...even if they don't do the same.

1077
01:48:54,230 --> 01:48:58,130
I don't care. I love all of them.
Including Buzz.

1078
01:48:59,230 --> 01:49:02,530
If I can't see all of them,
could I just see my mother?

1079
01:49:03,400 --> 01:49:07,470
I'll never want another thing, ever.
I just want my mother.

1080
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:09,500
I know it won't be tonight...

1081
01:49:09,830 --> 01:49:13,870
...but promise me I can see her again.
Sometime. Anytime.

1082
01:49:14,870 --> 01:49:18,340
Even if it's just once
and only for a few minutes.

1083
01:49:18,640 --> 01:49:20,910
I need to tell her I'm sorry.

1084
01:49:29,340 --> 01:49:30,710
Kevin?

1085
01:49:36,880 --> 01:49:37,750
Mom?

1086
01:49:40,450 --> 01:49:42,150
That worked fast!

1087
01:49:53,050 --> 01:49:54,520
Oh, Kevin.

1088
01:49:56,050 --> 01:49:57,790
Mom, I'm sorry.

1089
01:49:59,620 --> 01:50:01,260
I'm sorry too.

1090
01:50:13,800 --> 01:50:15,300
Merry Christmas, Mom.

1091
01:50:17,660 --> 01:50:19,800
Merry Christmas, sweetheart.

1092
01:50:21,300 --> 01:50:22,760
Thank you.

1093
01:50:23,430 --> 01:50:24,560
Let's go.

1094
01:50:25,430 --> 01:50:26,800
How'd you know I was here?

1095
01:50:27,030 --> 01:50:29,840
I know you and Christmas trees,
and this is the biggest.

1096
01:50:30,100 --> 01:50:31,300
Where's everyone else?

1097
01:50:31,540 --> 01:50:34,470
At the hotel.
They didn't like palm trees either.

1098
01:51:18,560 --> 01:51:20,990
Holy smokes, it's morning!

1099
01:51:22,360 --> 01:51:24,690
It's Christmas morning, man.

1100
01:51:25,790 --> 01:51:27,790
Don't get your hopes up.

1101
01:51:28,360 --> 01:51:29,260
Huh?

1102
01:51:29,530 --> 01:51:31,290
I don't think Santa visits hotels.

1103
01:51:31,690 --> 01:51:33,900
Are you nuts? He's omnipresent.

1104
01:51:34,100 --> 01:51:35,590
He goes everywhere.

1105
01:51:37,430 --> 01:51:39,130
Wake up, it's Christmas!

1106
01:51:43,800 --> 01:51:46,100
Mom! Dad! It's Christmas!

1107
01:51:58,540 --> 01:52:00,040
Wow.

1108
01:52:00,240 --> 01:52:01,770
Where'd it come from?

1109
01:52:02,040 --> 01:52:04,510
Mom! Dad! You gotta see this!

1110
01:52:08,310 --> 01:52:09,910
- My gosh!
- Peter!

1111
01:52:10,610 --> 01:52:12,550
Are we in the right room?

1112
01:52:18,110 --> 01:52:19,780
Don't open any of mine.

1113
01:52:20,150 --> 01:52:22,920
- Who's Mr. Duncan?
- Duncan? I don't know.

1114
01:52:23,380 --> 01:52:24,710
Everybody calm down.

1115
01:52:25,050 --> 01:52:27,180
Calm down!

1116
01:52:27,950 --> 01:52:29,490
All right. Now...

1117
01:52:30,020 --> 01:52:33,650
...if Kevin hadn't screwed up in
the first place, again...

1118
01:52:34,350 --> 01:52:36,990
...we wouldn't be
in this most perfect...

1119
01:52:37,190 --> 01:52:39,890
...and huge hotel room
with all this free stuff.

1120
01:52:40,690 --> 01:52:41,520
So...

1121
01:52:41,860 --> 01:52:45,390
...I think it only fair that Kevin
get to open the first gift.

1122
01:52:46,760 --> 01:52:49,490
Then I'll go and the rest
of you and so on.

1123
01:52:54,060 --> 01:52:55,660
Merry Christmas, Kev.

1124
01:52:56,430 --> 01:52:58,430
Merry Christmas, Buzz.

1125
01:53:00,530 --> 01:53:02,100
Merry Christmas, Kevin.

1126
01:53:03,500 --> 01:53:05,630
All right! Merry Christmas!

1127
01:53:07,870 --> 01:53:08,900
Enough gooey sh...

1128
01:53:09,870 --> 01:53:12,540
Show of emotion.
Everyone, let's dig in!

1129
01:53:15,270 --> 01:53:19,340
Everybody, save the paper.
We can use it next year. And the bows.

1130
01:53:55,350 --> 01:53:57,190
Merry Christmas.

1131
01:53:59,390 --> 01:54:00,420
Kevin!

1132
01:54:00,590 --> 01:54:02,230
Merry Christmas!

1133
01:54:03,090 --> 01:54:04,420
I got something for you.

1134
01:54:12,960 --> 01:54:13,960
What's this?

1135
01:54:14,600 --> 01:54:17,330
It's a turtledove. I have one.
You have one.

1136
01:54:17,600 --> 01:54:21,330
As long as we each have a turtledove,
we'll be friends forever.

1137
01:54:25,370 --> 01:54:27,900
Oh, Kevin.

1138
01:54:30,700 --> 01:54:32,170
Thank you.

1139
01:54:33,600 --> 01:54:36,300
I won't forget you. Trust me.

1140
01:55:04,350 --> 01:55:06,350
The room service bill, sir.

1141
01:55:08,680 --> 01:55:10,050
Merry Christmas.

1142
01:55:11,350 --> 01:55:12,920
Uh, oh.

1143
01:55:16,620 --> 01:55:17,920
Nice family.

1144
01:55:18,160 --> 01:55:19,290
Really.

1145
01:55:28,620 --> 01:55:30,190
Merry Christmas indeed.

1146
01:55:34,060 --> 01:55:35,460
Kevin!

1147
01:55:35,700 --> 01:55:38,500
You spent $967 on room service?!!

1148
01:55:38,501 --> 01:55:41,201
