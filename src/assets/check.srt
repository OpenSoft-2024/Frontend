1
00:00:00,459 --> 00:01:26,878
- Answer the phone.
- Where's my suitcase?

2
00:01:26,962 --> 00:01:31,800
I'm going downstairs.
Who stole my hair dryer?

3
00:01:31,883 --> 00:01:35,470
Miss. Young lady. Excuse me. Girls.

4
00:01:35,554 --> 00:01:38,640
Hey, hey, little fella.

5
00:01:38,724 --> 00:01:41,018
- Excuse me, girls. Girls.
- Take the witches!

6
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:43,270
Hey. Hey, big fella. Excuse me.

7
00:01:43,353 --> 00:01:45,772
Come help me make up
these beds in the living room!

8
00:01:45,856 --> 00:01:46,690
Excuse me. Ma'am!

9
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:49,192
- Hi. Hey, son! Son!
- Who stole my book bag?

10
00:01:49,276 --> 00:01:54,323
Big fella! Hey! Hey, hey, hey!
Little guy. Little guy!

11
00:01:54,406 --> 00:01:57,326
Pete's brother and his family
are here. It's crazy.

12
00:01:57,409 --> 00:01:59,661
- Trish is going to Montreal.
- Montreal?

13
00:01:59,745 --> 00:02:01,830
That's right. Her family's there.

14
00:02:01,913 --> 00:02:03,832
- And we're off.
- When do you leave?

15
00:02:03,915 --> 00:02:05,876
- Tomorrow.
- You're not ready, are you?

16
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:10,714
Mom! Uncle Frank won't let me watch
the movie, but the big kids can.

17
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:13,592
- Why can't I?
- Kevin, I'm on the phone.

18
00:02:13,675 --> 00:02:16,178
When do you come back? Not till then?

19
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:19,598
It's not even rated "R."
He's just being a jerk.

20
00:02:19,681 --> 00:02:22,976
Kevin, if Uncle Frank says no,

21
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:25,270
then it must be really bad.

22
00:02:25,354 --> 00:02:27,564
We're not bringing the dog.
We're putting him--

23
00:02:27,648 --> 00:02:29,983
Hey, hey, hey! Get off.
Kevin, out of the room.

24
00:02:30,067 --> 00:02:32,527
Hang up the phone and make me,
why don't ya?

25
00:02:32,611 --> 00:02:33,737
This kid.

26
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:36,531
Kate, did you by any chance
pick up a voltage adapter thing?

27
00:02:36,615 --> 00:02:38,575
I didn't have time to do that.

28
00:02:38,659 --> 00:02:40,535
How am I supposed to shave in France?

29
00:02:40,619 --> 00:02:43,497
- Grow a goatee.
- Dad, nobody'll let me do anything.

30
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:45,540
I've got something for you to do.

31
00:02:45,624 --> 00:02:48,126
Pick up those Micro Machines that are
all over in there.

32
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:50,420
Aunt Leslie stepped on one
and almost broke her neck.

33
00:02:50,504 --> 00:02:52,714
He was in the garage again,
playing with the glue gun.

34
00:02:52,798 --> 00:02:54,257
Didn't we talk about that?

35
00:02:54,341 --> 00:02:57,427
Did I burn down the joint?
I don't think so.

36
00:02:57,511 --> 00:03:01,515
- I was making ornaments out of fishhooks.
- My new fishhooks?

37
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:06,311
I can't make ornaments out of the old
ones, with dry worm guts stuck on 'em.

38
00:03:06,395 --> 00:03:10,315
- Peter.
- Come on, Kevin. Out.

39
00:03:10,399 --> 00:03:12,901
Peter, Kate, do you guys
have a voltage adapter?

40
00:03:12,984 --> 00:03:16,279
- Here! Here's a voltage adapter.
- You're getting heavy.

41
00:03:16,363 --> 00:03:18,490
Go pack your suitcase.

42
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:22,703
Pack my suitcase?

43
00:03:22,786 --> 00:03:25,288
- Do you know where the shampoo is, Fuller?
- I don't live here.

44
00:03:25,372 --> 00:03:27,874
A house with this many people,
there's no shampoo?

45
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:30,127
- Are your parents home?
- Yeah, but they don't live here.

46
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:32,921
- Tracy, did you order the pizza?
- Buzz did.

47
00:03:33,004 --> 00:03:36,299
- Excuse me, miss. Are your parents here?
- My parents live in Paris. Sorry.

48
00:03:36,383 --> 00:03:38,301
- Hi!
- Hi!

49
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:39,928
- Are your parents home?
- Yeah.

50
00:03:40,011 --> 00:03:41,930
- Do they live here?
- No.

51
00:03:42,013 --> 00:03:47,018
No. Why should they? All kids, no parents.
Probably a fancy orphanage.

52
00:03:47,102 --> 00:03:51,148
I don't know how to pack a suitcase. I've
never done this once in my whole life.

53
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:53,525
- Tough.
- That's what Megan said.

54
00:03:53,608 --> 00:03:56,361
- What did I say?
- You told Kevin, "Tough."

55
00:03:56,445 --> 00:03:59,197
The dope was whining about a suitcase.
What am I supposed to do?

56
00:03:59,281 --> 00:04:01,783
Shake his hand and say,
"Congratulations, you're an idiot"?

57
00:04:01,867 --> 00:04:04,786
- I'm not an idiot!
- Really? You're completely helpless!

58
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:07,622
- Everyone has to do everything for you.
- She's right, Kev.

59
00:04:07,706 --> 00:04:08,957
Excuse me, puke-breath.

60
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,543
I'm a lot smaller than you.
I don't know how to pack a suitcase.

61
00:04:11,626 --> 00:04:15,213
- I hope you didn't just pack crap, Jeff.
- Shut up, Linnie.

62
00:04:15,297 --> 00:04:17,215
Do you know what I should pack?

63
00:04:17,299 --> 00:04:20,594
Buzz told you, cheek-face.
Toilet paper and water.

64
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:23,680
Listen, Kev, what are
you so worried about?

65
00:04:23,764 --> 00:04:26,516
You know mom's gonna pack
your stuff anyway.

66
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,895
You're what the French call
les incompetents.

67
00:04:29,978 --> 00:04:33,940
- What?
- Bombs away!

68
00:04:37,652 --> 00:04:41,990
P.S. You have to sleep
on the hide-a-bed with Fuller.

69
00:04:42,073 --> 00:04:45,869
If he has something to drink,
he's gonna wet the bed.

70
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:48,705
This house is so full of people,
it makes me sick!

71
00:04:48,789 --> 00:04:51,875
When I grow up and get married,
I'm livin' alone!

72
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:54,795
Did you hear me? I'm livin' alone!

73
00:04:54,878 --> 00:04:57,631
I'm livin'alone!

74
00:05:00,091 --> 00:05:02,385
Who's gonna feed your spider
while we're gone?

75
00:05:02,469 --> 00:05:06,807
He just ate a whole load of mice guts. He
should be good for a couple weeks.

76
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:11,520
Is it true that French babes
don't shave their pits?

77
00:05:11,603 --> 00:05:14,272
Some don't.

78
00:05:14,356 --> 00:05:16,316
But they got nude beaches.

79
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:19,444
Not in the winter.

80
00:05:23,907 --> 00:05:27,828
- Buzz?
- Don't you know how to knock, phlegm-wad?

81
00:05:27,911 --> 00:05:31,498
Can I sleep in your room?
I don't want to sleep with Fuller.

82
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:33,542
If he has something to drink,
he'll wet the bed.

83
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:38,296
I wouldn't let you sleep
in my room if you were growing on my ass.

84
00:05:40,215 --> 00:05:43,301
Check it out. Old man Marley.

85
00:05:46,721 --> 00:05:48,765
Who is he?

86
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:53,103
You ever heard of
the South Bend Shovel Slayer?

87
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:55,230
- No.
- That's him.

88
00:05:55,313 --> 00:06:00,110
Back in '58, he murdered his whole family
and half the people on his block...

89
00:06:01,403 --> 00:06:03,613
with a snow shovel.

90
00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:06,992
Been hiding out in this
neighborhood ever since.

91
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:10,579
Well, if he's the Shovel Slayer,
how come the cops don't arrest him?

92
00:06:10,662 --> 00:06:12,581
Not enough evidence to convict.

93
00:06:12,664 --> 00:06:15,250
They never found the bodies.

94
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:17,544
But everyone around here knows he did it.

95
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:21,423
Now it'll just be a matter of time
before he does it again.

96
00:06:21,506 --> 00:06:23,508
What's he doin' now?

97
00:06:23,592 --> 00:06:27,554
He walks up and down
the streets every night...

98
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:29,931
salting the sidewalks.

99
00:06:30,015 --> 00:06:32,017
Maybe he's just trying to be nice.

100
00:06:33,685 --> 00:06:35,979
No way.

101
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:39,107
See that garbage can full of salt?

102
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:42,193
That's where he keeps his victims.

103
00:06:42,277 --> 00:06:45,196
The salt turns the bodies...

104
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:48,116
into mummies.

105
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:51,119
- Wow.
- Mummies.

106
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:57,542
Look out!

107
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:32,118
How you kids doin'? Good?

108
00:07:32,202 --> 00:07:34,913
Lot of action around here today?

109
00:07:34,996 --> 00:07:37,707
Goin' on vacation? Where you goin'?

110
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:42,128
Do you hear me or what? Goin'on a trip?

111
00:07:42,212 --> 00:07:44,255
Where you goin', kid?

112
00:07:53,682 --> 00:07:56,643
Okay, that's 122.50.

113
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:58,687
Not for me, kid. I don't live here.

114
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:02,774
- You just around for the holidays?
- I guess you could say that.

115
00:08:02,857 --> 00:08:06,236
- Hey, pizza's here!
- Here you go. That's 122.50.

116
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,989
It's my brother's house.
He'll take care of it.

117
00:08:09,072 --> 00:08:12,325
Hey, listen--

118
00:08:12,409 --> 00:08:15,829
- Hi.
- Hi. Are you Mr. McCallister?

119
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:18,248
- Yeah.
- The Mr. McCallister who lives here?

120
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:21,376
- Yes.
- Good, 'cause somebody owes me 122.50.

121
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:25,005
- I'd like a word with you, sir.
- Am I under arrest or something?

122
00:08:25,088 --> 00:08:28,925
No, no. It's Christmastime. There's always
a lot of burglaries around the holidays.

123
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:33,346
We're checking the neighborhood to see if
everyone's taking the proper precautions.

124
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:37,642
Yeah. Well, we have automatic timers
for our lights, locks for our doors.

125
00:08:37,726 --> 00:08:39,853
That's about as well as anybody can do.

126
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:42,147
- You get some eggnog?
- Come on, Dad.

127
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:44,149
- Let's eat.
- Come on.

128
00:08:44,232 --> 00:08:47,110
- Eggnog? Listen, are you gonna be leaving.
- Pizza! Pizza!

129
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:49,195
Pizza!

130
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:52,449
Grab yourself a napkin. You're
gonna have to pour your own drinks.

131
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:54,659
Does Santa Claus have
to go through customs?

132
00:08:54,743 --> 00:08:56,995
- What time do we have to go to bed?
- Early.

133
00:08:57,078 --> 00:08:59,581
We're leaving the house
at 8:00 a.m. on the button.

134
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:03,918
I hope you're all drinking milk. I want to
get rid of it. Hey! Don't you dare.

135
00:09:04,002 --> 00:09:07,172
Honey, the pizza boy needs $122.50,
plus a tip.

136
00:09:07,255 --> 00:09:08,131
For pizza?

137
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:10,091
Ten pizzas times 12 bucks.

138
00:09:10,175 --> 00:09:12,761
- Frank, you've got money. Come on.
- Traveler's checks.

139
00:09:12,844 --> 00:09:15,722
Forget it, Frank. We have cash.

140
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:18,475
You've probably got traveler's
checks that don't work in France.

141
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:21,561
Did anyone order me a plain cheese?

142
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:24,105
Yeah, we did. But if you want any,

143
00:09:24,189 --> 00:09:27,400
somebody's gonna have to barf it all up,
'cause it's gone.

144
00:09:27,484 --> 00:09:31,071
Fuller! Go easy on the Pepsi.

145
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:41,247
Kev! Kevin, get a plate.

146
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:50,173
Wow!

147
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:53,093
The passports! Watch it!

148
00:09:53,176 --> 00:09:56,304
Help me out here!

149
00:09:56,387 --> 00:09:59,224
Let's get these passports out of here.

150
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:02,769
- Kevin, get off of him!
- You moron!

151
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:06,481
Are you okay, honey?
Come here. Are you all right?

152
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:08,358
What is the matter with you?

153
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:11,361
He started it! He ate my pizza on purpose.

154
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:13,738
He knows I hate sausage and olives and--

155
00:10:13,822 --> 00:10:16,282
Look what you did, you little jerk!

156
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:32,423
- Kevin, get upstairs right now.
- Why?

157
00:10:32,507 --> 00:10:35,760
- Kevin, you're such a disease.
- Shut up.

158
00:10:35,844 --> 00:10:37,554
- Kevin, upstairs!
- Say good night, Kevin.

159
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:41,975
- Good night, Kevin.
- Now what's for dinner?

160
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:44,352
Why do I always get treated like scum?

161
00:10:44,435 --> 00:10:46,855
I'm sorry. This house is just crazy.

162
00:10:46,938 --> 00:10:48,857
We've got all these
extra kids running around.

163
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:52,610
My brother-in-law
drove in from Ohio today. It's just nuts.

164
00:10:52,694 --> 00:10:55,280
How come you didn't
bring more cheese pizzas?

165
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:57,448
Nice tip. Thanks a lot.

166
00:10:57,532 --> 00:10:59,742
- Thanks.
- Having a reunion or something?

167
00:10:59,826 --> 00:11:01,995
My husband's brother
transferred to Paris last summer...

168
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:04,080
and his kids are still going
to school here,

169
00:11:04,164 --> 00:11:05,957
and I guess
he missed the whole family.

170
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:08,668
He's giving us this trip
to Paris so we can be together.

171
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:12,589
- You're taking a trip to Paris?
- Yes, we hope to leave tomorrow morning.

172
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:14,966
Excellent. Excellent.

173
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:18,178
If you'll excuse me, this one's out of
sorts. I'll be right back.

174
00:11:18,261 --> 00:11:21,139
Don't worry about me. I spoke
to your husband already.

175
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:23,433
And don't worry about your home.

176
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:25,977
It's in good hands.

177
00:11:28,771 --> 00:11:32,275
There are 15 people in this house. You're
the only one that has to make trouble.

178
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:35,445
- I'm the only one getting dumped on.
- You're the only one acting up.

179
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:40,116
- Now get upstairs.
- I am upstairs, dummy.

180
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,827
- The third floor?
- Go.

181
00:11:42,911 --> 00:11:44,162
It's scary up there.

182
00:11:44,245 --> 00:11:46,164
Don't be silly.
Fuller will be up in a little while.

183
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:49,459
I don't want to sleep with Fuller. You
know about him. He wets the bed.

184
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:51,753
He'll pee all over me. I know it.

185
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:53,880
Fine. We'll put him somewhere else.

186
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:56,507
I'm sorry.

187
00:11:56,591 --> 00:11:59,135
It's too late. Get upstairs.

188
00:12:02,013 --> 00:12:04,182
Everyone in this family hates me.

189
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:06,559
Then maybe you should ask Santa
for a new family.

190
00:12:06,643 --> 00:12:10,313
I don't want a new family!
I don't want any family! Families suck!

191
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:13,608
Stay up there. I don't want to see you
again for the rest of the night.

192
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:16,361
I don't want to see you
for the rest of my life.

193
00:12:16,444 --> 00:12:19,155
And I don't want to see
anybody else either.

194
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:21,491
I hope you don't mean that.

195
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:23,409
You'd feel pretty sad
if you woke up tomorrow morning

196
00:12:23,493 --> 00:12:25,286
and you didn't have a family.

197
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:28,873
- No, I wouldn't.
- Then say it again.

198
00:12:28,957 --> 00:12:30,291
Maybe it'll happen.

199
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:33,419
I hope I never see
any of you jerks again.

200
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:57,568
I wish they would all just disappear.

201
00:13:54,417 --> 00:13:57,754
- Where are they?
- I don't know. She said 8:00 sharp.

202
00:14:06,137 --> 00:14:09,557
Peter!

203
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,642
We slept in!

204
00:14:28,368 --> 00:14:31,412
Hi. I'm Mitch Murphy.
I live across the street.

205
00:14:31,496 --> 00:14:34,874
You guys going out of town?
We're going to Orlando, Florida.

206
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:38,669
Well, actually, first we're going to
Missouri to pick up my grandma.

207
00:14:38,753 --> 00:14:41,339
Do you know the McCallisters
are going to France?

208
00:14:41,422 --> 00:14:45,301
Do you know if it's cold there? Do these
vans get good gas mileage?

209
00:14:45,385 --> 00:14:48,304
Gee, kid, I don't know. Hit the road.

210
00:14:51,099 --> 00:14:53,309
Heather, do a head count.
Make sure everyone's in the vans.

211
00:14:53,393 --> 00:14:55,311
Where are the passports and tickets?

212
00:14:55,395 --> 00:14:57,313
I put 'em in the microwave to dry 'em off.

213
00:14:57,397 --> 00:14:59,315
How fast does this thing go?

214
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:03,361
Does it have automatic transmission?
Does it have four-wheel drive?

215
00:15:03,444 --> 00:15:07,698
Look, I told you before, kid,
don't bother me. Now beat it.

216
00:15:15,123 --> 00:15:17,083
Come on. Hurry up.

217
00:15:18,793 --> 00:15:22,630
- Line up in front off the van.
- Did you take my batteries?

218
00:15:22,713 --> 00:15:25,133
- Line up and shut up!
- Wow!

219
00:15:25,216 --> 00:15:27,844
Shut up. I gotta take a head count.

220
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:32,056
- One, two, three, four, five--
- Eleven, 92, 12.

221
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:34,600
Buzz, don't be a moron.

222
00:15:34,684 --> 00:15:37,854
Six, seven, eight,

223
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:40,565
nine, 10, 11.

224
00:15:40,648 --> 00:15:43,860
Okay. Half in this van,
half in this van. Come on. Let's go.

225
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:46,487
Have a good trip.

226
00:15:46,571 --> 00:15:48,614
Bring me back something French.

227
00:15:51,284 --> 00:15:55,246
There's no way on earth we're gonna make
this plane. It leaves in 45 minutes.

228
00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:58,624
- Think positive, Frank.
- You be positive. I'll be realistic.

229
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:00,668
- Ma'am? Ma'am?
- What?

230
00:16:00,751 --> 00:16:02,753
I wanted to let you know
your power's fixed.

231
00:16:02,837 --> 00:16:06,382
Phone lines are a mess. Gonna take Ma Bell
a couple of days to patch 'em up.

232
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:08,926
- Especially around the holidays.
- Okay, thanks.

233
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:12,346
- Heather! Did you count heads?
- Eleven, including me.

234
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:17,268
Five boys, six girls, four parents, two
drivers and a partridge in a pear tree.

235
00:16:25,151 --> 00:16:28,279
♪ Out of all the reindeer

239
00:16:50,051 --> 00:16:51,969
This way!

240
00:16:52,053 --> 00:16:55,556
- Hold the plane!
- Did we miss the flight?

241
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:58,184
No, you just made it.

242
00:16:58,267 --> 00:17:00,353
Single seats only in coach.
Take whatever's free.

243
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:02,438
Thank you.

244
00:17:02,522 --> 00:17:04,732
I get a window seat!

245
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:09,153
You kids are in coach. We're up here.

246
00:17:09,237 --> 00:17:11,989
Here are your seats.
Five "A" and "B" and four "A" and "B."

247
00:17:12,073 --> 00:17:14,992
- I'll take your coats.
- Thank you.

248
00:17:15,076 --> 00:17:16,953
Fasten your seat belts, please.

249
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:19,622
- Champagne, please. It's free, isn't it?
- Yes.

250
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:23,417
- We made it.
- Do you believe it?

251
00:17:23,501 --> 00:17:25,670
Hope we didn't forget anything.

252
00:18:10,631 --> 00:18:13,050
What are you doing out of costume?

253
00:18:13,134 --> 00:18:15,052
Now get back and get dressed.

254
00:18:15,136 --> 00:18:17,263
I'm terribly sorry.
I thought you were our Santa Claus.

255
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:19,223
Your Santa Claus is intoxicated.

256
00:18:19,307 --> 00:18:21,475
- No.
- Yes.

257
00:18:21,559 --> 00:18:24,604
It's disgraceful!
How can you allow a man--

258
00:18:24,687 --> 00:18:29,984
♪ Jingle bells, jingle bells ♪

259
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:32,820
What do you mean by drinking?
You know it's not allowed!

260
00:18:32,903 --> 00:18:36,574
But it's cold.
A man's gotta do something to keep warm.

261
00:18:36,657 --> 00:18:38,534
I ought to take this cane and--

262
00:18:38,618 --> 00:18:43,289
Julia, get some black coffee
and plenty of it.

263
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:45,333
Black with a little cream.

264
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:47,627
Mom?

265
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:55,384
Thank you.

266
00:18:55,468 --> 00:18:58,679
- That's real crystal. It's real.
- Yeah. So?

267
00:18:58,763 --> 00:19:03,017
- Put 'em in your purse. Put 'em! Put 'em!
- I can't do that.

268
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:05,019
Put them in your purse!

269
00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:09,273
Yeah, yeah, fill it up, fill it up.
Fill it up, please.

270
00:19:09,357 --> 00:19:11,400
Thank you.

271
00:19:11,484 --> 00:19:14,779
Don't you feel like a heel flying first
class with the kids back in coach?

272
00:19:14,862 --> 00:19:16,906
No, the kids are fine.

273
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:19,325
Only flying I ever did as a kid
was in the family station wagon,

274
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:21,035
and it wasn't to France.

275
00:19:21,118 --> 00:19:24,121
We used to have to go over
to Aunt Laura and Uncle Arthur's house.

276
00:19:24,205 --> 00:19:26,374
The kids are okay.
They're having the time of their lives.

277
00:19:26,457 --> 00:19:27,416
Yeah.

278
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:30,503
Hello?

279
00:19:31,629 --> 00:19:33,631
Mom?

280
00:19:35,341 --> 00:19:37,385
Dad?

281
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:43,516
Mom? Dad?

282
00:19:45,518 --> 00:19:48,270
Where are you guys?

283
00:19:48,354 --> 00:19:50,356
Buzz?

284
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:53,734
Buzz?

285
00:19:56,696 --> 00:19:58,698
Buzz?

286
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:04,328
Megan?

287
00:20:04,412 --> 00:20:08,999
Hello? Hello?

288
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:12,086
Rod? Uncle Frank?

289
00:20:12,169 --> 00:20:14,505
Uncle Frank, is this a joke?

290
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:19,343
Megan? Linnie?

291
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:23,889
Is this a joke?

292
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:51,584
It's only my imagination.
Only my imagination.

293
00:21:08,642 --> 00:21:12,188
The cars are still here.
They didn't go to the airport.

294
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:33,876
I made my family disappear.

295
00:21:35,085 --> 00:21:37,171
Kevin, you're completely helpless.

296
00:21:37,254 --> 00:21:41,884
You know, Kevin, you're what the French
call les incompetents.

297
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:45,179
Kevin, I'm going
to feed you to my tarantula.

298
00:21:45,262 --> 00:21:48,265
Kevin, you are such a disease.

299
00:21:48,349 --> 00:21:50,559
There are 15 people in this house...

300
00:21:50,643 --> 00:21:53,479
and you're the only one
who has to make trouble.

301
00:21:53,562 --> 00:21:56,941
Look what you did, you little jerk.

302
00:22:00,694 --> 00:22:03,864
I made my family disappear.

303
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:22,258
I'm free! Free! Free!

304
00:22:32,142 --> 00:22:34,144
Wow!

305
00:22:40,067 --> 00:22:43,821
No clothes on anybody. Sickening!

306
00:22:43,904 --> 00:22:48,075
Cool! Firecrackers!
I'll save these for later.

307
00:22:48,158 --> 00:22:51,161
Buzz, I'm going through
all your private stuff!

308
00:22:51,245 --> 00:22:54,206
You better come out and pound me!

309
00:22:57,543 --> 00:23:00,796
Buzz, your girlfriend! Woof!

310
00:23:49,553 --> 00:23:51,555
Who is it?

311
00:23:54,975 --> 00:23:57,937
It's me, Snakes. I got the stuff.

312
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:01,148
Leave it on the doorstep
and get the hell out of here.

313
00:24:01,231 --> 00:24:04,401
All right, Johnny.
But what about my money?

314
00:24:04,485 --> 00:24:05,778
What money?

315
00:24:05,861 --> 00:24:08,072
Acey said you had
some dough for me.

316
00:24:08,155 --> 00:24:11,116
Is that a fact? How much do I owe you?

317
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:14,078
Acey said 10%.

318
00:24:14,161 --> 00:24:16,872
Too bad Acey ain't in charge no more.

319
00:24:16,956 --> 00:24:18,040
What do you mean?

320
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:19,875
Guys, I'm eating junk
and watching rubbish!

321
00:24:19,959 --> 00:24:22,962
You better come out and stop me!

322
00:24:23,045 --> 00:24:25,673
He'll call you when he gets out.

323
00:24:25,756 --> 00:24:27,466
Hey.

324
00:24:27,549 --> 00:24:30,302
I tell you what I'm gonna
give you, Snakes.

325
00:24:31,929 --> 00:24:34,223
I'm gonna give you to the count of 10...

326
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:37,434
to get your ugly, yellow,

327
00:24:37,518 --> 00:24:39,645
no-good keister off my property...

328
00:24:39,728 --> 00:24:41,814
before I pump your guts full of lead.

329
00:24:41,897 --> 00:24:44,525
All right, Johnny, I'm sorry. I'm goin'.

330
00:24:44,608 --> 00:24:47,152
One, two, ten!

331
00:25:02,418 --> 00:25:04,837
Keep the change, ya filthy animal.

332
00:25:06,463 --> 00:25:08,090
Mom!

333
00:25:19,435 --> 00:25:22,021
What's the matter?

334
00:25:22,104 --> 00:25:24,523
Honey?

335
00:25:24,606 --> 00:25:28,152
- I have a terrible feeling.
- About what?

336
00:25:29,236 --> 00:25:31,363
That we didn't do something.

337
00:25:31,447 --> 00:25:34,783
No, you feel that way
because we left in such a hurry.

338
00:25:34,867 --> 00:25:36,952
We took care of everything.
Believe me, we did.

339
00:25:37,036 --> 00:25:38,203
Did I turn off the coffee?

340
00:25:38,287 --> 00:25:41,206
No. I did.

341
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:43,292
Did you lock up?

342
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:45,294
Yeah.

343
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:48,047
Did you close the garage?

344
00:25:50,049 --> 00:25:53,886
That's it. I forgot to close
the garage. That's it.

345
00:25:59,475 --> 00:26:01,810
No, that's not it.

346
00:26:02,978 --> 00:26:05,189
What else could we be forgetting?

347
00:26:09,068 --> 00:26:11,320
Kevin!

348
00:26:37,554 --> 00:26:40,224
Whoa!

349
00:26:41,225 --> 00:26:45,020
Whoa! Whoa!

350
00:26:53,737 --> 00:26:56,990
The captain's doing all he can.
Your phones are still out of order.

351
00:26:57,074 --> 00:27:01,495
We'll call as soon as we land, Kate.
I'm sure everything's okay.

352
00:27:01,578 --> 00:27:05,207
It's horrible. Horrible. Just horrible.

353
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:08,377
How could we do this? We forgot him.

354
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:10,754
We didn't forget him.
We just... miscounted.

355
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:14,133
What kind of mother am I?

356
00:27:14,216 --> 00:27:17,970
If it makes you feel any better,
I forgot my reading glasses.

357
00:27:22,641 --> 00:27:25,310
Five families gone on one block alone.

358
00:27:25,394 --> 00:27:28,313
They all told me from their own mouths.

359
00:27:28,397 --> 00:27:30,357
It's almost too easy.

360
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:34,361
Check it out.
All the houses with nobody home...

361
00:27:34,444 --> 00:27:37,573
have automatic timers on their lights.

362
00:27:37,656 --> 00:27:40,576
But I got it all figured out. Watch this.

363
00:27:42,119 --> 00:27:45,539
Number 664 will be going on...

364
00:27:45,622 --> 00:27:48,876
right about... now.

365
00:27:50,544 --> 00:27:53,714
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

366
00:27:53,797 --> 00:27:56,383
Number 672,

367
00:27:57,593 --> 00:28:00,262
right... now.

368
00:28:00,345 --> 00:28:03,599
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

369
00:28:03,682 --> 00:28:07,936
671... now.

370
00:28:10,022 --> 00:28:13,400
And that's the one, Marvin.
That's the silver tuna.

371
00:28:13,483 --> 00:28:15,652
It's very "G."

372
00:28:15,736 --> 00:28:18,697
Very "G," It's loaded.

373
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:21,200
It's got lots of topflight goods.

374
00:28:21,283 --> 00:28:24,745
- Stereos, VCR's.
- Toys.

375
00:28:24,828 --> 00:28:29,333
Probably lookin' at some very fine
jewelry. Possible cash hoard.

376
00:28:29,416 --> 00:28:33,670
Odd marketable securities. Who knows?

377
00:28:33,754 --> 00:28:35,964
It's a gem.

378
00:28:36,048 --> 00:28:38,050
Grab your crowbar.

379
00:28:39,343 --> 00:28:41,303
Crowbars up.

Which way?

386
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:44,283
We'll go around back down
the basement. Follow me.

387
00:30:04,177 --> 00:30:06,263
I thought you said they were gone.

388
00:30:06,346 --> 00:30:08,181
They were supposed
to leave this morning.

389
00:30:08,265 --> 00:30:10,183
Let's get out of here.

390
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:49,264
We have to use the phone, please.

391
00:30:49,348 --> 00:30:52,142
It's an emergency.
We really have to make a call.

392
00:30:52,225 --> 00:30:55,270
Please! Our brother's home alone.

393
00:30:55,354 --> 00:30:58,607
- Give us the phone!
- Thank you. I'm sorry. Thank you.

394
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:01,693
Peter, I'm gonna call the police. Why
don't you book us a flight home.

395
00:31:01,777 --> 00:31:06,406
Get some change out of here.
Call everybody you know. Leslie.

396
00:31:06,490 --> 00:31:09,743
Here's my address book. You and Frank call
everybody who lives on our street.

397
00:31:09,826 --> 00:31:11,745
Maybe somebody can help us.

398
00:31:11,828 --> 00:31:15,957
Hello? Hello? Hello?
She'll have to call you back.

399
00:31:21,046 --> 00:31:25,008
This is ridiculous.
Only a wimp would be hiding under a bed.

400
00:31:25,092 --> 00:31:29,221
And I can't be a wimp.
I'm the man of the house.

401
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:39,398
Hey! I'm not afraid anymore!

402
00:31:40,816 --> 00:31:44,778
I said, I'm not afraid anymore!

403
00:31:44,861 --> 00:31:47,781
Do you hear me? I'm not afraid anymore!

404
00:32:18,728 --> 00:32:20,730
Village Police Department.

405
00:32:20,814 --> 00:32:24,359
Hi. Look, I'm calling from Paris.
I have a son who's home alone.

406
00:32:24,443 --> 00:32:27,863
Our phones are out of order,
so I'd like somebody to go to our house...

407
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:29,865
and tell him we're coming home to get him.

408
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:32,033
Let me connect you
with Family Crisis Intervention.

409
00:32:32,117 --> 00:32:34,953
- It's not a family crisis.
- Hold on.

410
00:32:35,036 --> 00:32:40,375
Larry, can you pick up? There's some lady
on hold, sounds kind of hyper.

411
00:32:40,459 --> 00:32:43,211
- What line, Rose?
- Two.

412
00:32:43,295 --> 00:32:45,922
Family Crisis Intervention.
Sergeant Balzak.

413
00:32:46,006 --> 00:32:49,009
I am calling from Paris.
I have a son who's home alone.

414
00:32:49,092 --> 00:32:51,011
Has the child been involved
in a violent altercation...

415
00:32:51,094 --> 00:32:53,930
with a drunken and/or mentally ill member
of his immediate family?

416
00:32:54,014 --> 00:32:55,098
No.

417
00:32:55,182 --> 00:32:57,976
Has he been involved
in a household accident?

418
00:32:58,059 --> 00:33:00,312
I don't know. I don't-- I hope not.

419
00:33:00,395 --> 00:33:02,898
Has the child ingested any poison...

420
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:05,692
and/or any other object
that has become lodged in his throat?

421
00:33:05,775 --> 00:33:09,362
No, he's just home alone! I would like
somebody to go over to the house...

422
00:33:09,446 --> 00:33:12,324
and see that he's all right,
just to check on him.

423
00:33:12,407 --> 00:33:16,036
You want us to go to your house
just to check on him?

424
00:33:16,119 --> 00:33:17,412
Yes!

425
00:33:17,496 --> 00:33:19,623
Let me connect you
with the police department.

426
00:33:19,706 --> 00:33:22,209
- They just transferred me to you.
- Rose?

427
00:33:22,292 --> 00:33:24,753
- Yeah?
- Hyper on two. Hold on, please.

428
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:28,798
No, please don't hang up.
Please, don't-- Any luck?

429
00:33:28,882 --> 00:33:32,511
No. We couldn't get anybody.

430
00:33:32,594 --> 00:33:33,720
Leslie?

431
00:33:33,803 --> 00:33:36,431
I'm sorry, Kate. Nothing but
a bunch of answering machines.

432
00:33:38,642 --> 00:33:42,312
Somebody pick up. Pick up!

433
00:33:42,395 --> 00:33:44,940
- Hi, ma'am. It's you again.
- Yeah, hi. Look.

434
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:47,901
I'm calling from Paris.
I have a son who's home alone, and I--

435
00:33:47,984 --> 00:33:51,947
Okay, okay. We'll send a policeman over to
your house to check on your son.

436
00:34:22,185 --> 00:34:24,938
There's no one home.
The house looks secure.

437
00:34:25,021 --> 00:34:28,066
- Tell 'em to count their kids again.
- Ten-four.

438
00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:30,694
I can't believe you can't
bump somebody or ask somebody--

439
00:34:30,777 --> 00:34:33,530
I'm sorry, but there's
no way I can do that.

440
00:34:33,613 --> 00:34:35,532
Isn't there a way if you ask somebody?

441
00:34:35,615 --> 00:34:38,159
- If you explained this is an emergency.
- I wish I could--

442
00:34:38,243 --> 00:34:40,704
They're sending a policeman over
to the house to check on Kevin.

443
00:34:40,787 --> 00:34:43,832
That's a relief.
Everything here is booked.

444
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:45,166
There's nothing to Chicago?

445
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:48,545
There's nothing to Chicago, New York,
Nashville. You name it. Everything's gone.

446
00:34:48,628 --> 00:34:53,049
- What about a private plane?
- No, I'm sorry. We don't do that.

447
00:34:53,133 --> 00:34:56,219
The only thing they have is a booking for
all of us on Friday morning.

448
00:34:56,303 --> 00:34:58,555
Friday morning? That's two days away.

449
00:34:58,638 --> 00:35:01,057
Look, honey,
the kids are exhausted. You are exhausted.

450
00:35:01,141 --> 00:35:03,852
There's absolutely nothing
more we can do in this airport.

451
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:08,023
I say we go to Rob's, call the police
again, and they can get back to us.

452
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:11,943
Kevin is home all by himself. I'm not
leaving here unless it's on an airplane.

453
00:35:12,027 --> 00:35:13,945
Madame, we are doing everything we can.

454
00:35:14,029 --> 00:35:17,991
If you want to stay at the airport, maybe
we can get you on standby.

455
00:35:18,074 --> 00:35:21,494
It is a possibility
that a seat will open up.

456
00:35:21,578 --> 00:35:24,706
- Is that okay?
- Yes. I'll wait.

I took a shower,
washing every body part with actual soap,

468
00:36:00,283 --> 00:36:04,829
including all my major crevices, including
in between my toes and in my belly button,

469
00:36:04,913 --> 00:36:07,374
which I never did before,
but sort of enjoyed.

470
00:36:07,457 --> 00:36:10,126
I washed my hair
with adult-formula shampoo...

471
00:36:10,210 --> 00:36:13,380
and used cream rinse
for that just-washed shine.

472
00:36:13,463 --> 00:36:17,509
I can't seem to find my toothbrush, so
I'll pick one up when I go out today.

473
00:36:17,592 --> 00:36:19,594
Other than that, I'm in good shape.

474
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,880
Whoa!

475
00:37:09,769 --> 00:37:13,106
All right! Buzz's life savings.

476
00:37:40,175 --> 00:37:43,094
I thought the Murphys went to Florida.

477
00:37:58,943 --> 00:38:02,530
You know, you're one of the great cat
burglars of the world, Marv.

478
00:38:02,614 --> 00:38:04,491
You think you could keep it
down a little in there?

479
00:38:06,034 --> 00:38:10,121
Hi, you've reached the Murphys. Please
leave a message after you hear the beep.

480
00:38:10,205 --> 00:38:12,290
Chuck, this is Peter McCallister again,

481
00:38:12,373 --> 00:38:15,001
and we're still in Paris
at my brother's apartment.

482
00:38:15,084 --> 00:38:18,213
Let me give you the number here, okay?
The country code is 3-3.

483
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:20,173
The area code is 1 -4.

484
00:38:20,256 --> 00:38:23,843
And the number is 694-8764.

485
00:38:23,927 --> 00:38:25,720
- Hey, Harry?
- Yeah?

486
00:38:25,804 --> 00:38:28,681
That house we were at last night,
was that the McCallisters?

487
00:38:28,765 --> 00:38:31,184
- Yeah.
- Call me in Paris.

488
00:38:31,267 --> 00:38:33,853
You're right. They're gone.

489
00:38:37,273 --> 00:38:40,109
- I knew they were.
- Silver tuna tonight.

490
00:38:42,195 --> 00:38:44,239
Wow.

491
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:51,329
How may I help you?

492
00:38:51,412 --> 00:38:55,291
Is this toothbrush approved
by the American Dental Association?

493
00:38:55,375 --> 00:38:58,127
Well, I don't know.

494
00:38:58,211 --> 00:39:02,048
- It doesn't say, hon.
- Can you please find out?

495
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:07,053
- Herb!
- Yeah?

496
00:39:07,136 --> 00:39:10,974
I've got a question here
about a toothbrush.

497
00:39:16,479 --> 00:39:20,775
Do you know, is this toothbrush approved
by the American Dental Association?

498
00:39:20,859 --> 00:39:22,819
I don't know.

499
00:39:43,590 --> 00:39:48,011
- Just tell him that--
-Hon, you pay for that here.

00:39:48,094 --> 00:39:50,054
Why don't you just tell him it's approved?

501
00:39:50,138 --> 00:39:53,516
Wait, son, you have to pay
for that toothbrush. Son?

502
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,560
Son! Hey!

503
00:39:55,643 --> 00:39:59,397

504
00:40:02,775 --> 00:40:06,154
Hey! Hey!

Shoplifter!

506
00:40:13,036 --> 00:40:14,954
Hey! Hey, kid!

Come back here!

508
00:40:17,749 --> 00:40:20,501
Watch it!

509
00:40:21,836 --> 00:40:23,671
Come back here!

510
00:40:23,755 --> 00:40:27,675
Stop it, will ya! Come here!

511
00:40:30,386 --> 00:40:32,472
Whoa! Whoa!

512
00:40:34,098 --> 00:40:37,477
Whoa! Whoa!

513
00:40:39,771 --> 00:40:42,440
Yeehaw!

514
00:41:06,255 --> 00:41:08,257
I'm a criminal.

515
00:41:35,368 --> 00:41:38,162
What's so funny?

516
00:41:38,246 --> 00:41:40,915
What's so funny? What are you laughin' at?

517
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:45,503
You did it again, didn't you?

518
00:41:45,586 --> 00:41:48,297
You left the water runnin', didn't you?

519
00:41:48,381 --> 00:41:51,592
What's wrong with you?
I told you not to do it.

520
00:41:51,676 --> 00:41:53,594
Harry, it's our calling card.

521
00:41:53,678 --> 00:41:56,389
- Calling card.
- All the great ones leave their mark.

522
00:41:56,472 --> 00:41:58,433
We're the "Wet Bandits."

523
00:41:58,516 --> 00:42:01,394
You're sick, you know that?
You're really sick.

524
00:42:01,477 --> 00:42:03,396
- I'm not sick.
- Yes, you are.

525
00:42:03,479 --> 00:42:05,440
- I'm not sick!
- That's a sick thing to do!

526
00:42:12,155 --> 00:42:13,239
We don't need that heat.

527
00:42:13,322 --> 00:42:16,159
Don't tell me what to do.
I can do it if I want to.

528
00:42:16,242 --> 00:42:19,078
- You're sick.
- I'm not sick.

529
00:42:19,162 --> 00:42:22,248
Hey, watch out!

530
00:42:28,796 --> 00:42:32,383
Hey. Hey! You gotta watch out
for traffic, son, you know?

531
00:42:32,467 --> 00:42:34,886
- Sorry.
- Damn.

532
00:42:34,969 --> 00:42:37,263
Santy don't visit the funeral homes,
little buddy.

533
00:42:37,346 --> 00:42:39,515
Okay, okay.

534
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:42,977
Merry Christmas.

535
00:42:52,361 --> 00:42:53,321
What's the matter?

536
00:42:53,404 --> 00:42:55,740
I don't like the way
that kid looked at me.

537
00:42:55,823 --> 00:42:57,700
- Did you see that?
- You ever seen him before?

538
00:42:57,784 --> 00:43:00,578
I saw a hundred kids this week.

539
00:43:00,661 --> 00:43:03,164
Let's see what house he goes into.

540
00:43:34,737 --> 00:43:37,031
Why is he goin' faster?

541
00:43:37,115 --> 00:43:41,577
I told you something's wrong. I knew he
looked at me weird. Why would he run?

542
00:44:16,946 --> 00:44:21,033
- Maybe he went in the church.
- I'm not goin' in there.

543
00:44:21,117 --> 00:44:23,911
- Me neither.
- Let's get out of here.

544

00:46:42,383 --> 00:46:45,219
Parlez anglais?

I'm looking for my son!
Do you know where he is?

572
00:46:55,563 --> 00:47:00,901
I can't find anybody. They've all gone
shopping. Nobody's home for the holidays.

573
00:47:00,985 --> 00:47:03,112
Never mind. Forget it.

574
00:47:03,195 --> 00:47:05,239
This is so pointless.

575
00:47:05,323 --> 00:47:09,076
- What?
- We're here rotting in this apartment.

576
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:11,370
Kevin's at home. Mom's at the airport.

577
00:47:11,454 --> 00:47:13,622
- So?
- You're not at all worried about Kevin?

578
00:47:13,706 --> 00:47:15,750
Why should I be?

579
00:47:15,833 --> 00:47:19,378
He's acted like a jerk too many times,
and this time he caught it in the butt.

580
00:47:19,462 --> 00:47:24,050
But he's so little and helpless.
Don't you think he's flipped out?

581
00:47:24,133 --> 00:47:27,345
The little trout can use
a couple of days in the real world.

582
00:47:27,428 --> 00:47:29,805
You're not worried that something
might happen to him?

583
00:47:29,889 --> 00:47:32,350
No. For three reasons.

584
00:47:32,433 --> 00:47:35,102
I'm not that lucky.

585
00:47:35,186 --> 00:47:37,521
Two: We have smoke detectors.

586
00:47:37,605 --> 00:47:41,567
And "D": We live in the most boring street
in the United States of America...

587
00:47:41,650 --> 00:47:46,072
where nothing even remotely dangerous
will ever happen, period.

588
00:48:13,182 --> 00:48:14,350
Who is it?

589
00:48:14,433 --> 00:48:16,602
It's Little Nero's, sir.
I have your pizza.

590
00:48:16,685 --> 00:48:19,855
Leave it on the doorstep
and get the hell outta here.

591
00:48:19,939 --> 00:48:22,775
Okay.

592
00:48:22,858 --> 00:48:25,069
Um, well, what about the money?

593
00:48:26,237 --> 00:48:27,863
What money?

594
00:48:27,947 --> 00:48:31,367
Well, you have to pay for your pizza, sir.

595
00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:33,744
Is that a fact?

596
00:48:33,828 --> 00:48:36,038
How much do I owe you?

597
00:48:36,122 --> 00:48:39,417
That'll be 11.80, sir.

598
00:48:45,756 --> 00:48:49,135
Keep the change, ya filthy animal.

599
00:48:51,011 --> 00:48:52,930
- Cheapskate.
- Hey.

600
00:48:53,013 --> 00:48:56,809
I'm gonna give you to the count
of 10 to get your ugly,

601
00:48:56,892 --> 00:49:00,229
yellow, no-good keister off my property...

602
00:49:00,312 --> 00:49:02,481
before I pump your guts full of lead.

603
00:49:02,565 --> 00:49:04,525
One, two, ten!

604
00:49:33,512 --> 00:49:36,515
A lovely cheese pizza just for me.

605
00:49:39,935 --> 00:49:42,188
To Dallas-Fort Worth.

606
00:49:45,566 --> 00:49:48,027
We have the $500, the pocket translator,

607
00:49:48,110 --> 00:49:50,779
the two first-class seats--
that's an upgrade from your coach--

608
00:49:50,863 --> 00:49:54,658
- Is that a real Rolex?
- Do you think it is?

609
00:49:54,742 --> 00:49:57,411
- No.
- But who can tell?

610
00:49:57,495 --> 00:50:01,457
- I also have a ring.
- That is beautiful!

611
00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:04,126
Come on. They're boarding.

612
00:50:04,210 --> 00:50:07,713
This gal has offered us
two first-class tickets if we go Friday.

613
00:50:07,796 --> 00:50:11,300
Plus a ring, a watch,
a pocket translator, $500 and--

614
00:50:11,383 --> 00:50:14,178
- The earrings. You love the earrings.
- She's got her own earrings.

615
00:50:14,261 --> 00:50:16,931
A whole shoe box full of 'em.
Dangley ones.

616
00:50:17,014 --> 00:50:18,974
- Come on, come on.
- No, but--

617
00:50:19,058 --> 00:50:21,101
I'm desperate.

618
00:50:21,185 --> 00:50:23,103
I'm begging you.

00:50:23,187 --> 00:50:26,649

620
00:50:28,108 --> 00:50:30,736
- Ed.
- Please.

621
00:50:30,819 --> 00:50:33,531
All right.

622
00:50:39,161 --> 00:50:41,205

624

- Okay.

644
00:53:17,569 --> 00:53:19,655
Are you here all by yourself?

645
00:53:19,738 --> 00:53:25,327
Ma'am, I'm eight years old.
You think I would be here alone?

646
00:53:25,411 --> 00:53:27,746
I don't think so.

- I'm an only child.

650

- Where do you live?
- I can't tell you that.

651
00:53:38,173 --> 00:53:41,218
- Why not?
- 'Cause you're a stranger.

Hello, Kevin!

653
00:54:24,303 --> 00:54:27,765
Shut up.

654
00:54:40,736 --> 00:54:42,654
I don't get it.

655
00:54:42,738 --> 00:54:45,407
I mean, right now it looks
like there's nobody home.

656
00:54:45,491 --> 00:54:49,161
Last night the place is jumpin'.

657

659
00:55:03,550 --> 00:55:05,427
No, tomorrow, egghead. Now!

660
00:55:05,511 --> 00:55:08,222
Go ahead!

661
00:55:08,305 --> 00:55:10,516
"Now?"

662
00:55:27,825 --> 00:55:30,202
Shit.

663
00:55:31,995 --> 00:55:34,957
- Get the hell outta here.
- All right, Johnny.

664
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:38,126
- But what about my money?
- What money?

665
00:55:38,210 --> 00:55:41,004
Acey said you had some dough for me.

666
00:55:41,088 --> 00:55:44,007
Is that a fact?
How much do I owe you?

667
00:55:44,091 --> 00:55:45,968
Acey said 10%.

668
00:55:46,051 --> 00:55:51,056
- Two bad Acey ain't in charge no more.
- What do you mean?

669
00:55:51,139 --> 00:55:54,560
He's upstairs taking a bath.

670
00:55:54,643 --> 00:55:57,354

00:55:57,437 --> 00:55:59,314
Hey.

00:55:59,398 --> 00:56:02,442
I tell you what
I'm gonna give you, Snakes.

673
00:56:02,526 --> 00:56:06,405
- Snakes?
- I'm gonna give you to the count of 10...

674
00:56:06,488 --> 00:56:08,824
to get your ugly, yellow,

675
00:56:08,907 --> 00:56:13,370
no-good keister off my property
before I pump your guts full of lead.

676
00:56:13,453 --> 00:56:16,164
All right, Johnny, I'm sorry. I'm goin'.

677
00:56:16,248 --> 00:56:19,167
One, two, ten!

678
00:56:38,395 --> 00:56:41,607
Keep the change, ya filthy animal.

679
00:56:45,569 --> 00:56:46,987
What happened?

680
00:56:47,070 --> 00:56:49,448
I don't know who's in there,
but somebody just got blown away!

681
00:56:50,574 --> 00:56:52,576
Somebody beat us to the job.
They're in there!

682
00:56:52,659 --> 00:56:56,663
Two of 'em. There was arguing.
One of 'em blew the other one away.

683
00:56:56,747 --> 00:56:58,498
- Who?
- I don't know.

684
00:56:58,582 --> 00:57:01,001
I thought I recognized
one of their voices.

685
00:57:01,084 --> 00:57:04,296
And I know I heard that name
Snakes before.

686
00:57:04,379 --> 00:57:06,924
Snakes? Snakes, Snakes.

687
00:57:07,007 --> 00:57:09,134
- I don't know no Snakes.
- Snakes.

688
00:57:09,217 --> 00:57:11,803
Let's get out of here.

689
00:57:14,181 --> 00:57:16,850
Hold it, hold it.
Let's wait and see who it is.

690
00:57:16,934 --> 00:57:18,894
We work this neighborhood too.

691
00:57:18,977 --> 00:57:21,730
- Yeah.
- Supposin' the cops finger us for a job...

692
00:57:21,813 --> 00:57:24,900
and they start asking us
questions about a murder in the area.

693
00:57:24,983 --> 00:57:28,111
Wouldn't it be nice to have a face to go
with their questions?

694
00:57:29,988 --> 00:57:31,949
That's a good idea.

695
00:57:32,032 --> 00:57:35,494
Of course it's a good idea. Snakes?

696
00:57:35,577 --> 00:57:38,497
He sounded like a snake.

697
00:57:42,501 --> 00:57:45,671
Everything's full.

698
00:57:45,754 --> 00:57:47,673
Everything's full?

699
00:57:47,756 --> 00:57:50,008
I'm very sorry, but it is Christmas Eve.

700
00:57:50,092 --> 00:57:52,219
What about another airline?

701
00:57:56,098 --> 00:58:00,644
Nothing available. May I help you get
a hotel room in the city?

702
00:58:00,727 --> 00:58:02,896
Tomorrow afternoon we can
get you a flight to Chicago.

703
00:58:02,980 --> 00:58:04,272
I can't wait that long.

704
00:58:04,356 --> 00:58:08,777
I'm terribly sorry, ma'am, but we're doing
absolutely everything we can.

705
00:58:12,906 --> 00:58:16,076
Go ahead. I'm in your way.
You have places to go, people to see.

706
00:58:16,159 --> 00:58:19,496
You got a ticket there.
That's good. Excuse me. Look.

707
00:58:19,579 --> 00:58:23,583
I have been awake for almost 60 hours.
I'm tired and I'm dirty.

708
00:58:23,667 --> 00:58:28,171
I have been from Chicago to Paris to
Dallas to-- Where the hell am I?

709
00:58:28,255 --> 00:58:30,257
Scranton.

710
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:33,051
I am trying to get home
to my eight-year-old son!

711
00:58:33,135 --> 00:58:36,555
And now that I'm this close,
you're telling me it's hopeless?

712
00:58:36,638 --> 00:58:40,308
- I'm sorry.
- No. No, no. Wait. This is Christmas!

713
00:58:40,392 --> 00:58:43,270
- The season of perpetual hope!
- Ma'am if--

714
00:58:43,353 --> 00:58:46,148
If I have to get out
on your runway and hitchhike,

715
00:58:46,231 --> 00:58:48,233
if it costs me everything I own,

716
00:58:48,316 --> 00:58:51,194
if I have to sell my soul
to the devil himself,

717
00:58:51,278 --> 00:58:54,448
I am going to get home to my son.

718
00:58:54,531 --> 00:58:58,285
Ma'am, if there was anything at
all I could do for you today--

719
00:58:58,368 --> 00:59:01,413
- Do it. Do anything.
- I can get you a hotel room.

720
00:59:01,496 --> 00:59:03,957
- What?
- Excuse me.

721
00:59:04,041 --> 00:59:09,755
Can you excuse us for a second? Can I see
you for a second? Please. Excuse us. Come.

722
00:59:09,838 --> 00:59:13,091
Couldn't help but hearin'
you got a little bit of a dilemma there.

723
00:59:13,175 --> 00:59:15,761
We got a crisis ourselves.

724
00:59:15,844 --> 00:59:19,306
Allow me to introduce myself.
Gus Polinski. How are you?

725
00:59:19,389 --> 00:59:22,851
Polka king of the Midwest?

726
00:59:25,729 --> 00:59:28,482
The Kenosha Kickers?

727
00:59:28,565 --> 00:59:30,192
- Hi there.
- Hiya.

728
00:59:30,275 --> 00:59:33,195
No? That's okay. I thought
you might've recognized--

729
00:59:33,278 --> 00:59:36,281
Anyways, I had
a few hits a few years ago.

730
00:59:36,364 --> 00:59:39,618
That's why, you know--
"Polka, Polka, Polka"?

731
00:59:39,701 --> 00:59:42,079
♪ Polka, polka, polka ♪

732
00:59:42,162 --> 00:59:44,206
No? "Twin Lakes Polka."

733
00:59:44,289 --> 00:59:47,709
"Yamahoozie Polka,"
a.k.a. "Kiss Me Polka."

734
00:59:47,793 --> 00:59:50,504
- "Polka Twist."
- These are songs?

735
00:59:50,587 --> 00:59:54,007
Yeah. Yeah. We--
Some fairly big hits for us.

736
00:59:54,091 --> 00:59:56,676
You know, in the early '70s, you know?

737
00:59:56,760 --> 00:59:59,429
Yeah, we sold about 623 copies of that.

738
00:59:59,513 --> 01:00:02,140
- In Chicago?
- No. Sheboygan. Very big in Sheboygan.

739
01:00:02,224 --> 01:00:04,392
I'm sorry. Did you say you could help me?

740
01:00:04,476 --> 01:00:06,686
Anyway, I'm rambling on here.

741
01:00:06,770 --> 01:00:09,856
Our flight was canceled,
so we gotta drive.

742
01:00:09,940 --> 01:00:13,527
So, see the guy in the yellow jacket
over there by the Budget sign?

743
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:17,364
He's gonna rent us a nice big, van,
and we're gonna drive to Milwaukee.

744
01:00:17,447 --> 01:00:20,117
I heard you had some problems
here, gettin' to Chicago

745
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:21,785
to see your kid or somethin'?

746
01:00:21,868 --> 01:00:25,997
My son. He-- We left and he's there.

747
01:00:26,081 --> 01:00:30,168
Aw, geez. If you have to get to Chicago,
we'll gladly drive you.

748
01:00:30,252 --> 01:00:32,546
It's on the way to Milwaukee.

749
01:00:32,629 --> 01:00:35,340
- You'd give me a ride?
- Sure we will. Why not, you know?

750
01:00:35,423 --> 01:00:37,926
- You gotta get home and see your kid.
- A ride to Chicago?

751
01:00:38,009 --> 01:00:39,886
Sure. You know, it's Christmastime.

752
01:00:39,970 --> 01:00:42,514
Thank you. Thank you.

753
01:00:42,597 --> 01:00:44,891
If you don't mind goin'
with some polka bums.

754
01:00:44,975 --> 01:00:46,935
No, I'd love to.

755
01:01:08,623 --> 01:01:11,543
- Hey, Marv, Marv, Marv.
- What?

756
01:01:11,626 --> 01:01:14,129
Look at this.

757
01:01:18,675 --> 01:01:23,054
I think we're gettin' scammed
by a "kindygartener."

758
01:01:53,126 --> 01:01:55,712
Dad, can you come here and help me?

759
01:02:00,217 --> 01:02:04,471
Remember that kid we saw the other day?
He lives here.

760
01:02:04,554 --> 01:02:07,474
Well, if the kid's there,
the parents gotta be.

761
01:02:07,557 --> 01:02:10,143
He's home alone.

762
01:02:17,901 --> 01:02:20,320
You gotta be kiddin'.
You wanna come back tonight?

763
01:02:20,403 --> 01:02:22,364
Even with the kid here?

764
01:02:22,447 --> 01:02:24,574
I don't think that's a good idea.

765
01:02:24,658 --> 01:02:28,119
That house is the only reason we started
workin' this block in the first place.

766
01:02:28,203 --> 01:02:30,956
Ever since I laid eyes
on that house, I wanted it.

767
01:02:31,039 --> 01:02:33,416
So let's take it one step at a time, okay?

768
01:02:33,500 --> 01:02:37,003
We'll unload the van. We'll get a bite
to eat. We'll come back about 9:00.

769
01:02:37,087 --> 01:02:40,048
- 9:00.
- This way it's dark then.

770
01:02:40,131 --> 01:02:43,218
Yeah. Kids are scared of the dark.

771
01:02:43,301 --> 01:02:46,221
You're afraid of the dark too,
Marv. You know you are.

772
01:02:46,304 --> 01:02:49,015
No, I'm not!

773
01:02:49,099 --> 01:02:51,559
- Yes, you are.
- I'm not, not, not.

774
01:02:51,643 --> 01:02:55,939
- You are so.
- Mom, where are you?

775
01:03:09,327 --> 01:03:11,246
Do you play?

776
01:03:11,329 --> 01:03:13,373
You want to try it? Go ahead. Try it.

777
01:03:13,456 --> 01:03:15,792
- Try it. Try it.
- No.

778
01:03:15,875 --> 01:03:17,919
Okay.

779
01:03:42,110 --> 01:03:45,572
- Excuse me.
- Yeah?

780
01:03:45,655 --> 01:03:49,617
- Hey, nice shoes.
- Thanks.

781
01:03:49,701 --> 01:03:53,413
Is he still here?
It's really important that I see him.

782
01:03:53,496 --> 01:03:58,793
He's getting in his car.
I guess if you hurry, you can catch him.

783
01:03:58,877 --> 01:04:03,381
Damn! How low can you get? Givin' Kris
Kringle a parking ticket on Christmas Eve.

784
01:04:03,465 --> 01:04:06,551
What's next? Rabies shots
for the Easter Bunny?

785
01:04:06,634 --> 01:04:09,262
Santa, hold on!

786
01:04:09,346 --> 01:04:11,473
Can I talk to you for a minute?

787
01:04:11,556 --> 01:04:14,559
If you make it quick. Santa's got a little
get-together he's late for.

788
01:04:14,642 --> 01:04:16,561
Okay. I know you're not
the real Santa Claus.

789
01:04:16,644 --> 01:04:20,565
What makes you say that?
Just out of curiosity.

790
01:04:20,648 --> 01:04:23,276
I'm old enough to know how it works.

791
01:04:23,360 --> 01:04:26,488
- All right.
- But I also know that you work for him.

792
01:04:26,571 --> 01:04:29,616
- And I'd like you to give him a message.
- Shoot.

793
01:04:29,699 --> 01:04:33,828
I'm Kevin McCallister,
671 Lincoln Boulevard.

794
01:04:33,912 --> 01:04:36,581
- Do you need the phone number?
- No, that's all right.

795
01:04:36,664 --> 01:04:39,000
Okay. This is extremely important.

796
01:04:39,084 --> 01:04:41,795
Would you please tell him that,
instead of presents this year,

797
01:04:41,878 --> 01:04:43,797
I just want my family back.

798
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:48,802
No toys. Nothing but Peter, Kate, Buzz,
Megan, Linnie and Jeff.

799
01:04:48,885 --> 01:04:51,096
And my aunt and my cousins.

800
01:04:51,179 --> 01:04:54,391
And, if he has time, my Uncle Frank. Okay?

801
01:04:56,101 --> 01:04:59,270
Okay. I'll see what I can do.

802
01:04:59,354 --> 01:05:02,315
- Thanks.
- Wait. Hold on a second.

803
01:05:02,399 --> 01:05:05,568
My elf took the last
of the candy canes home to her boyfriend.

804
01:05:05,652 --> 01:05:07,654
- That's okay.
- No, no, no. Don't be silly.

805
01:05:07,737 --> 01:05:10,782
Everybody who sees Santa
has gotta get... somethin'.

806
01:05:10,865 --> 01:05:13,118
Here. Hold out your little paw there.

807
01:05:13,201 --> 01:05:16,287
There you go. Don't spoil your dinner.

808
01:05:16,371 --> 01:05:18,998
I won't. Thanks.

809
01:05:29,884 --> 01:05:32,470

- ♪ O holy night ♪
- She's about your age.

851
01:08:53,546 --> 01:08:55,798

852
01:08:55,882 --> 01:08:58,968
- You live next to me, don't you?
- Yeah.

853
01:08:59,052 --> 01:09:03,556
You can say hello when you see me.
You don't have to be afraid.

854
01:09:03,640 --> 01:09:07,560
There's a lot of things going around
about me, but none of it's true.

855
01:09:07,644 --> 01:09:09,562
Okay?

856
01:09:09,646 --> 01:09:11,856
- You been a good boy this year?
- I think so.

857
01:09:11,939 --> 01:09:14,025
Swear to it?

858
01:09:14,108 --> 01:09:16,861
- No.
- Yeah, I had a feeling.

859
01:09:16,944 --> 01:09:20,114
Well, this is the place to be
if you're feeling bad about yourself.

860
01:09:20,198 --> 01:09:23,076
- It is?
- I think so.

861
01:09:23,159 --> 01:09:25,912
- Are you feeling bad about yourself?
- No.

862
01:09:29,999 --> 01:09:32,418
I've been kind of a pain lately.

863
01:09:32,502 --> 01:09:34,921
I said some things I shouldn't have.

864
01:09:35,004 --> 01:09:38,299
I really haven't been too good this year.

865
01:09:38,383 --> 01:09:41,219
- Yeah.
- I'm kind of upset about it,

866
01:09:41,302 --> 01:09:43,513
because I really like my family.

867
01:09:43,596 --> 01:09:46,140
Even though sometimes I say I don't.

868
01:09:46,224 --> 01:09:49,602
Sometimes I even think I don't.
Do you get that?

869
01:09:49,686 --> 01:09:54,232
I think so. How you feel about your family
is a complicated thing.

870
01:09:54,315 --> 01:09:57,860
Especially with an older brother.

871
01:09:57,944 --> 01:10:02,198
Deep down you always love 'em, but you can
forget that you love 'em.

872
01:10:02,281 --> 01:10:05,034
And you can hurt them,
and they can hurt you.

873
01:10:05,118 --> 01:10:08,871
And that's not just because you're young.

874
01:10:08,955 --> 01:10:12,208
You want to know the real reason
that I'm here right now?

875
01:10:12,291 --> 01:10:14,293
Sure.

876
01:10:14,377 --> 01:10:17,922
I came to hear my granddaughter sing,
and I can't come and hear her tonight.

877
01:10:18,005 --> 01:10:23,678
- You have plans?
- No. I'm not welcome.

878
01:10:23,761 --> 01:10:27,598
- At church?
- You're always welcome at church.

879
01:10:27,682 --> 01:10:30,101
I'm not welcome with my son.

880
01:10:30,184 --> 01:10:34,897
Years back, before you and
your family moved on the block,

881
01:10:34,981 --> 01:10:37,525
I had an argument with my son.

882
01:10:37,608 --> 01:10:41,863
- How old is he?
- He's grown up.

883
01:10:41,946 --> 01:10:44,574
We lost our tempers,

884
01:10:44,657 --> 01:10:47,618
and I said I didn't care
to see him anymore.

885
01:10:47,702 --> 01:10:52,623
He said the same, and we haven't
spoken to each other since.

886
01:10:52,707 --> 01:10:55,585
If you miss him, why don't you call him?

887
01:10:55,668 --> 01:10:58,421
I'm afraid if I call him,
he won't talk to me.

888
01:10:58,504 --> 01:11:00,673
How do you know?

889
01:11:00,757 --> 01:11:03,801
I don't know. I'm just afraid he won't.

890
01:11:03,885 --> 01:11:07,555
No offense, but aren't you
a little old to be afraid?

891
01:11:07,638 --> 01:11:11,267
You can be a little old
for a lot of things.

892
01:11:11,350 --> 01:11:13,603
You're never too old to be afraid.

893
01:11:13,686 --> 01:11:16,439
That's true. I've always
been afraid of our basement.

894
01:11:16,522 --> 01:11:19,984
It's dark, there's weird stuff
down there, and it smells funny.

895
01:11:20,067 --> 01:11:23,488
That sort of thing.
It's bothered me for years.

896
01:11:23,571 --> 01:11:26,032
Basements are like that.

897
01:11:26,115 --> 01:11:29,035
Then I made myself go down there
to do some laundry,

898
01:11:29,118 --> 01:11:31,120
and I found out it's not so bad.

899
01:11:31,204 --> 01:11:33,498
All this time I've been worrying about it,

900
01:11:33,581 --> 01:11:35,875
but if you turn on the lights,
it's no big deal.

901
01:11:35,958 --> 01:11:40,421
- What's your point?
- My point is you should call your son.

902
01:11:40,505 --> 01:11:42,548
What if he won't talk to me?

903
01:11:42,632 --> 01:11:46,010
At least you'll know. Then you
could stop worrying about it,

904
01:11:46,093 --> 01:11:48,721
and you won't have to be afraid anymore.

905
01:11:48,805 --> 01:11:52,350
I don't care how mad I was,
I'd talk to my dad,

906
01:11:52,433 --> 01:11:54,393
especially around the holidays.

907
01:11:54,477 --> 01:11:57,647
I don't know.

908
01:11:57,730 --> 01:12:00,900
Just give it a shot.
For your granddaughter anyway.

909
01:12:00,983 --> 01:12:04,362
I'm sure she misses you...
and the presents.

910
01:12:04,445 --> 01:12:06,280
I send her a check.

911
01:12:06,364 --> 01:12:10,743
I wish my grandparents
send that. They always send me clothes.

912
01:12:10,827 --> 01:12:13,704
Last year I got a sweater
with a big bird knitted on it.

913
01:12:13,788 --> 01:12:17,083
- That's nice.
- Not for a guy in the second grade.

914
01:12:17,166 --> 01:12:20,127
You can get beat up
for wearing something like that.

915
01:12:20,211 --> 01:12:22,338
Yeah.

916
01:12:22,421 --> 01:12:23,756
I have a friend who got nailed

917
01:12:23,840 --> 01:12:26,634
'cause there was a rumor
he wore dinosaur pajamas.

918
01:12:26,717 --> 01:12:30,054
You'd better run along home
where you belong.

919
01:12:30,137 --> 01:12:32,014
You think about what I said.

920
01:12:32,098 --> 01:12:33,891
- All right?
- Okay.

921
01:12:33,975 --> 01:12:37,895
- It was nice talking to you.
- Nice talking to you.

Yeah, come on, kid. Open up.

No, I'm really scared!

970
01:22:54,887 --> 01:22:57,514
It's too late for you, kid.
We're already in the house.

971
01:22:57,598 --> 01:23:01,685
- We're gonna get you!
- Okay. Come and get me.

972
01:23:01,768 --> 01:23:04,396
Why, you--

973
01:23:08,775 --> 01:23:11,278
Now you're dead!

01:23:35,511 --> 01:23:38,096
I'm gonna kill that kid!

01:23:52,486 --> 01:23:55,572
- Marv!
- Harry?

976
01:23:55,656 --> 01:23:57,658
Why the hell'd you take your shoes off?

977
01:23:57,741 --> 01:24:00,953
Why the hell are you
dressed like a chicken?

978
01:24:02,329 --> 01:24:06,124
I'm up here, you morons! Come and get me!

979
01:24:08,293 --> 01:24:12,005
You guys give up,
or are you thirsty for more?

980
01:24:21,723 --> 01:24:24,142
Heads up!

981
01:24:24,226 --> 01:24:27,437
Don't worry, Marv. I'll get him for you.

982
01:24:31,149 --> 01:24:34,570
Yes!

983
01:24:38,699 --> 01:24:41,451
He's only a kid, Harry. We can take him.

984
01:24:41,535 --> 01:24:43,620
Aw, shut up, will ya!

985
01:24:43,704 --> 01:24:46,665
- What is it?
- You're missin' some teeth.

986
01:24:46,748 --> 01:24:50,961
Where? It's my gold tooth.
My gold tooth! I'll kill him!

987
01:24:51,044 --> 01:24:54,464
I'll kill him!

988
01:24:54,548 --> 01:24:57,342
You bomb me with one more can, kid,

989
01:24:57,426 --> 01:25:01,638
and I'll snap off your cojones
and boil them in motor oil!

990
01:25:04,057 --> 01:25:06,226
911 Emergency.

991
01:25:06,310 --> 01:25:09,062
Help. My house is being robbed.

992
01:25:09,146 --> 01:25:13,734
My address is 656 Lincoln Boulevard.
My name's Murphy.

993
01:25:16,403 --> 01:25:18,989
Watch it. You never know what's up there.

994
01:25:19,072 --> 01:25:21,992
There he is!

995
01:25:23,076 --> 01:25:26,246
I got ya!

996
01:25:26,330 --> 01:25:29,708
I got him, Harry! Harry, I got him!

997
01:25:29,791 --> 01:25:32,878
Harry, get up! Give me a hand!

998
01:25:32,961 --> 01:25:37,090
I got him!

999
01:25:37,174 --> 01:25:40,719
Harry, help me! Get up!

1000
01:25:40,802 --> 01:25:43,597
I got him!

1001
01:26:22,135 --> 01:26:26,973
- What are you doing, Marv?
- Harry, don't move.

1002
01:26:27,057 --> 01:26:31,019
- Marv?
- Don't... move!

1003
01:26:31,103 --> 01:26:34,439
Marv, what are you doing? Marv--

1004
01:26:37,484 --> 01:26:41,113
Did I get him? Did I get him?

1005
01:26:41,196 --> 01:26:43,532
Where is it? Where is it?

1006
01:26:43,615 --> 01:26:46,827
Never mind did you get it!
How do you like it?

1007
01:26:46,910 --> 01:26:50,706
You jerk! Get that kid!
Go on! Get the kid!

1008
01:26:54,084 --> 01:26:57,462
Whoa! Whoa!

1009
01:26:57,546 --> 01:27:01,049
Whoa! Whoa!

1010
01:27:01,133 --> 01:27:04,302
Whoa! Whoa!

1011
01:27:16,815 --> 01:27:18,984
Where'd he go?

1012
01:27:19,067 --> 01:27:21,111
Maybe he committed suicide.

1013
01:27:21,194 --> 01:27:23,321
Down here, you big horse's ass!

1014
01:27:23,405 --> 01:27:26,408
Come and get me before I call the police!

1015
01:27:26,491 --> 01:27:28,702
- Let's get him!
- Wait. Wait.

1016
01:27:28,785 --> 01:27:30,746
That's just what he wants us to do--

1017
01:27:30,829 --> 01:27:34,332
us to go back downstairs through his fun
house so we get all tore up.

1018
01:27:34,416 --> 01:27:37,669
- He's gonna call the cops!
- He's not callin' the-- From a tree house?

1019
01:27:37,753 --> 01:27:39,671
Come on.

1020
01:27:39,755 --> 01:27:42,007
- Out the window?
- Yeah.

1021
01:27:42,090 --> 01:27:44,801
- I'm not goin' out the window.
- Why? Are you scared, Marv?

1022
01:27:44,885 --> 01:27:47,512
Are you afraid? Come on. Get out here.

1023
01:27:52,100 --> 01:27:54,019
Come on.

1024
01:27:57,564 --> 01:28:02,194
Come on!

1025
01:28:05,947 --> 01:28:08,492
Come on. Keep goin'. Keep goin'.

1026
01:28:08,575 --> 01:28:11,578
- Let's go back, Harry.
- Shut up!

1027
01:28:11,661 --> 01:28:14,873
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.

1028
01:28:14,956 --> 01:28:17,876
Shut it, Marv!

1029
01:28:20,253 --> 01:28:23,215
Hey, guys, check this out.

1030
01:28:23,298 --> 01:28:26,092
Go back! Go back!

1031
01:28:26,176 --> 01:28:27,677
- Go back.
- Okay.

1032
01:28:51,952 --> 01:28:56,915
There he goes! There he is!
Get out of the way, you dope!

1033
01:29:14,516 --> 01:29:19,229
- There he is!
- Hey, I'm calling the cops.

1034
01:29:19,312 --> 01:29:22,274
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
He wants us to follow him.

1035
01:29:22,357 --> 01:29:24,484
I got a better idea. Come on.

1036
01:29:41,418 --> 01:29:45,755
Hiya, pal. We outsmarted you this time.

1037
01:29:45,839 --> 01:29:48,842
Get over here!

1038
01:29:52,345 --> 01:29:54,347
What are we gonna do to him, Harry?

1039
01:29:54,431 --> 01:29:58,852
We'll do exactly what he did to us. I'm
gonna burn his head with a blowtorch.

1040
01:29:58,935 --> 01:30:01,146
Then we can smash his face with an iron!

1041
01:30:01,229 --> 01:30:05,150
I'd like to slap him right in the face
with a paint can maybe.

1042
01:30:05,233 --> 01:30:07,694
Or shove a nail through his foot.

1043
01:30:07,777 --> 01:30:11,114
I'm gonna bite off every one of these
little fingers one at a time.

1044
01:30:19,664 --> 01:30:25,086
- Come on. Let's get you home.
- Whoa!

1045
01:30:44,773 --> 01:30:48,944
Wow. This is great.

1046
01:30:51,613 --> 01:30:54,491
Nice move-- always
leaving the water running.

1047
01:30:54,574 --> 01:30:57,827
Now we know each and every
house that you've hit.

1048
01:31:00,664 --> 01:31:04,417
Hey, you know, we've been looking for you
two guys for a long time.

1049
01:31:04,501 --> 01:31:07,462
- Yeah.
- Well, remember, we're the Wet Bandits.

1050
01:31:07,545 --> 01:31:11,716
-Wet Bandits. W-E-T--
-Shut up! Get in the car!

1051
01:31:11,800 --> 01:31:14,636
Hey, come on. Come on.

1052
01:31:14,719 --> 01:31:17,138

I'm a bad parent. I'm a bad parent.

1067
01:32:15,405 --> 01:32:18,450
You're not. You know, you're beating
yourself up there, you know.

1068
01:32:18,533 --> 01:32:21,077
Come on. This happens.
These things happen. You know, you--

1069
01:32:21,161 --> 01:32:24,581
Gee, you wanna talk about bad parents?
Look at-- Look at us.

1070
01:32:24,664 --> 01:32:29,127
I mean, we're on the road 48, 49 weeks out
of the year. We hardly see our families.

1071
01:32:29,210 --> 01:32:32,005
Joe over there--
Gosh, you know, he's--

1072
01:32:33,048 --> 01:32:35,425
He forgets his kids' names half the time.

1073
01:32:35,508 --> 01:32:39,262
Ziggy over there-- He doesn't even--
He's never even met his kid.

1074
01:32:39,345 --> 01:32:43,058
Eddie-- Let's just hope none
of them write a book about him.

1075
01:32:43,141 --> 01:32:48,021
Tell me, have you ever gone on vacation
and left your child home?

1076
01:32:50,857 --> 01:32:52,942
No.

1077
01:32:53,026 --> 01:32:56,529
But I did leave one
at a funeral parlor once.

1078
01:32:56,613 --> 01:32:58,823
Yeah, it was-- it was terrible too.

1079
01:32:58,907 --> 01:33:02,243
You know, I was all distraught and
everything. You know, the wife and I,

1080
01:33:02,327 --> 01:33:06,331
we left the little tyke
there in the funeral parlor all day.

1081
01:33:06,414 --> 01:33:10,335
All day. You know, and we went back at
night when we came to our senses.

1082
01:33:10,418 --> 01:33:13,922
And there he was. Apparently he was there
alone all day with a corpse.

1083
01:33:14,005 --> 01:33:16,674
Yeah. He was okay, you know.

1084
01:33:16,758 --> 01:33:21,679
After six, seven weeks, you know, he came
around and started talking again.

1085
01:33:21,763 --> 01:33:26,184
But he's okay. You know, they get over it.
Kids are resilient like that.

1086
01:33:26,267 --> 01:33:29,020
- Maybe we shouldn't talk about this.
- Well, you brought it up.

1087
01:33:29,104 --> 01:33:32,148
- I was just trying to cheer you up.
- Well, I'm sorry I did.

1088
01:33:58,049 --> 01:33:59,968
Mom?

1089
01:34:04,556 --> 01:34:06,474
Mom?

1090
01:34:09,811 --> 01:34:12,605
Mom?

1091
01:34:58,318 --> 01:35:02,405
Kevin? Kevin!

1092
01:35:33,394 --> 01:35:35,688
Merry Christmas, sweetheart.

1093
01:35:44,864 --> 01:35:47,617
Kevin, I'm so sorry.

1094
01:36:07,178 --> 01:36:09,305
Where is everybody else?

1095
01:36:09,389 --> 01:36:13,518
Baby, they couldn't come.
They wanted to so much, but--

1096
01:36:13,601 --> 01:36:18,189
I didn't fall asleep in the back of the
cab and drool all over you, did I?

1097
01:36:18,273 --> 01:36:20,566
- I don't drool.
- You guys, would you shut up!

1098
01:36:20,650 --> 01:36:23,987
Come on, you guys, it's Christmas. Kevin!
Kevin, Kevin, my boy!

1099
01:36:24,070 --> 01:36:25,989
- My God!
- Kevin, how are ya?

1100
01:36:26,072 --> 01:36:27,991
- Merry Christmas.
- Hi, Mom.

1101
01:36:28,074 --> 01:36:30,827
Good to see you. You're all right.
I love you. You okay?

1102
01:36:30,910 --> 01:36:33,579
- Yeah.
- Hey, Kev.

1103
01:36:35,665 --> 01:36:39,294
It's pretty cool that
you didn't burn the place down.

1104
01:36:39,377 --> 01:36:43,131
Thanks, Buzz.

1105
01:36:43,214 --> 01:36:46,092
Wait a minute. How did you guys get home?

1106
01:36:46,175 --> 01:36:49,595
We took the morning flight. Remember?
The one you didn't want to wait for.

1107
01:36:49,679 --> 01:36:52,348
No. Thank you.

1108
01:36:52,432 --> 01:36:54,392
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

1109
01:36:54,475 --> 01:36:56,686
Someone has to find an open store.
We don't have milk.

1110
01:36:56,769 --> 01:37:00,773
I went shopping yesterday.

1111
01:37:00,857 --> 01:37:02,734
You? Shopping?

1112
01:37:02,817 --> 01:37:05,737
I got some milk, eggs and fabric softener.

1113
01:37:07,238 --> 01:37:09,657
- What?
- No kiddin'?

1114
01:37:09,741 --> 01:37:13,786
What a funny guy.
What else did you do while we were away?

1115
01:37:13,870 --> 01:37:16,831
Just hung around.

1116
01:37:19,667 --> 01:37:21,836
You guys, put the stuff upstairs.

1117
01:37:21,919 --> 01:37:25,757
You went shopping? He doesn't know how to
tie his shoe, and he's going shopping?

1118
01:37:25,840 --> 01:37:28,593
- Buzz, forget it.
- This is not the Kevin I knew.

1119
01:37:52,033 --> 01:37:54,410
Honey, what's this?

1120
01:38:52,009 --> 01:38:55,680
